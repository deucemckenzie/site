2000 Albums
-----------

The decades generally don't break down into convenient, thematic chunks and this
is such a case. Most of what was popular, and certainly what I like from 2000
was the work of artists that rose to prominence in the 90s. The next year,
millennial indie would break, and dominate the popular consciousness and my list
of favorites. What we have below is a grab bag of acts with roots in early 90s
alternative, late 90s indie, and other trends of the past (With one new band
that points forward to what was to come).

This year I was busy, having relocated to State College, PA to continue my
education. I wasn't paying as much attention to new music and it shows, with only
five of the albums something I heard in the year of release. The music I was
listening to at the time was either from decades gone by, or things from the
current day that I really don't care for anymore.

- *Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons* by **Blonde Redhead** - The earlier, noisier
  records have some appeal to me, but this album is where I really get on-board.
  The creepy, dreamy electronic sound with ethereal vocals is the formula that
  worked best for me. "This Is Not" is the perfect halfway point of their
  experimental tendencies and pop song skills. [*Memory*: This album really
  reminds me of my move to Rochester, NY as I was very into this around 2008/09.]

- *Poem* by **Delerium** - This was a turn to a more mainstream sensibility,
  designed to capitalize on the newfound success of the prior two records.
  Electronic music was becoming a dominant force in the clubs and world music
  beats were still very much in vogue. There is an increased focus on
  collaborations with guest vocalists, and most of them work out very well. A
  particular highlight is "Innocente" featuring Leigh Nash of **Sixpence and
  None the Richer**. There are still some great atmospheric instrumental tracks
  to complement the vocal collabs. [*Memory*: The following year I would
  purchase my first MP3 player specifically to use on my runs. For some reason,
  this was one of the records I would put on my running playlists.]

- *Lost Souls* by **Doves** - I prefer the following two records which were more
  in the UK indie mold, but this is a very good record as well. A very post-rock
  influenced effort, the songs are long and moody. Every now and then we get
  one of those little pop gems that would define their later work. [*Memory*: I
  heard this some years after their other releases. For some reason it wasn't
  easy to find in the US until the late 2000s.]

- *Raise Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven* by **Godspeed You! Black
  Emperor** - [**2000 FAVORITE**] - Their finest work, and probably the best
  thing to come out of the much maligned genre of post-rock. This is heavy,
  gorgeous music that never stops being interesting. That somewhat not quite
  right, but completely beautiful interval played by the brass in the first
  moments of "Storm" gets me every time. I'll never get tired of hearing the
  story of Murray Ostril describing his childhood visits to Coney Island on
  "Sleep". One of the greatest albums of all time, and one the band would never
  quite match.

- *Tonight and the Rest of My Life* by **Nina Gordon** - I'm not sure why we
  only got one really good record from this artist, because it is really, really
  good. **Gordon** has a great voice, and a rock sensibility that separates this
  music from the other woman singer songwriters in this area. I really wish we
  had gotten way more of this. [*Memory*: This makes me think about how
  different music discovery was back in the day. I heard the title track off of
  this on VH1 around the time of release. It really peaked my interest, but not
  enough to run out and spend my hard earned cash on the CD. It wasn't until I
  saw a used copy at a Cash Converters two years later that I heard the whole
  and album and realized how much I like it. Today I would stream it on Spotify
  immediately and the whole process would play out much faster.]
  
- *The Sophtware Slump* by **Grandaddy** - Not a happy record. A haunting,
  psychedelic cycle of songs that feels like the overture to the pervasive
  negativity and malaise of the G.W. era. It manages to find some real beauty in
  the melancholy, but I have to be in the right mood for this. [*Memory*: 2008
  was a difficult year in my life, and I remember connecting with this dreary
  record. I listened to it repeatedly working in the lab at my job at the time.
  I was semi-permanently living out of hotels in Rochester, and working all the
  time. This music made total sense in that context.]

- *Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea* by **PJ Harvey** - For many
  years, I tended to dismiss this as a sellout for mainstream accessability.
  This is still Polly at her most mainstream, but it retains her best qualities
  as well. It is also the last record will will ever probably get with her
  trademark belting/growling vocal style. I now realize just because she threw in
  some stunning pop rock singles like "You Said Something" it doesn't make this
  any less of a **PJ Harvey** record. [*Memory*: Showing how resistant I was to
  this record, it ended up being the very last of her records I bought on CD
  (Even after the very mediocre *Uh Huh, Her*).]

- *The Moon and Antarctica* by **Modest Mouse** - In retrospect it is becoming
  clear that this is by far their best work. Wonderfully eccentric songwriting,
  and creative arrangements, they are firing on all cylinders. It never drifts
  into the sameness of their early records, and avoids the bland pop that would
  creep into the later records. One of the finest early indie records.
  [*Memory*: I bought the CD re-issue of this as a doorbuster sale at Best Buy
  black friday in 2004. What a different time, in so many ways.]

- *Bachelor No. 2: The Last Remains of the Dodo* by **Aimee Mann** - Possibly
  the finest record in the "music you will hear at Starbucks genre". Smartly
  written and produced folk leaning alt-rock. I love how her songs take
  unexpected turns into epic territory during the bridge or second chorus, and
  sometimes both like "How Am I Different".

- *Return of Saturn* by **No Doubt** - The intersection of the 90s ska sound
  that the band was famous for, and the early 2000s pop sound that frontwoman
  Gwen Stefani would help create. I like this way more than anything else by the
  band or the singer, and it is perhaps the last great 90s alt-rock record.
  [*Memory*: I had been resistant to this band until this record came out.
  Somehow it was the pop sweetness of "Simple Kind of Life" that would get me
  onboard.]
  
- *Stankonia* by **Outkast** - These guys were always a breath of fresh air. In
  the 90s their joyful funky hip hop was the antidote we needed to soulless
  gangsta rappers, and the conscious hip hop here is just what was needed in the
  face of the bling era. I'm far from an expert in the genre, but this is my top
  rap record of all time. [*Memory*: I started watching MTV in 2000 after
  hearing the hip hop hits of the day at college parties at Penn State. That is
  where I heard these guys, and the songs "Mrs. Jackson" and the absolutely
  stellar "B.O.B" lead me to this record.]

- *Binaural* by **Pearl Jam** - This is definitely the record where these guys
  started to sound older. The ballads were creeping in, and they were generally
  pretty great (e.g. "Light Years"). That said, after this point they would
  start to feel a bit self derivative. This in some ways is the last time we
  would get rockers like "Rival" that didn't feel like a re-projection of past
  glory. [*Memory*: It took me a while to become a full-blown Pearl Jam fan, and
  I was only really fully on board when this record came out. At the time, this
  was probably my favorite album of the year.]

- *Lightbulb Sun* by **Porcupine Tree** - It seemed like this was the year that
  all the 90s acts were becoming softer and more introspective. That included
  the kings of 90s prog. A very somber but beautiful record, and a big contrast
  of the prog metal that was coming next. [*Memory*: I would have loved to hear
  this record when it came out, but thanks to the slow distribution of their
  music in the states, I didn't hear it until ordering UK imports on Amazon
  became a thing around 2006.]

- *Kid A* by **Radiohead** - I like the actual songs here more than the
  meandering instrumentals, which haven't aged very well. This set the
  blueprint for a decade of layered electronic indie. [*Memory*: At the time I
  didn't like this very much in comparison to the more rock forward sound of
  **The Bends**, but I have grown to appreciate it over time.]

- *Liquid* by **Recoil** - A very strange electronic concept record. It doesn't
  feel as sinister as it did at the time, and is admittedly a little comically
  over-dark in retrospect. Their use of slam poets for lyrics also makes this
  sound incredibly dated. There still are some interesting songs here like
  "Supreme", "Jezebel", and "Chrome", even if the whole thing doesn't work
  anymore. [*Memory*: A friend of mine at work loved this record and played it
  constantly, but I kinda hated it. After many listens I finally started to warm
  up to it. I never liked it enough to buy my own copy, and I only had the CD-R
  I burned from my friend for over a decade. I'll still put it on from time to
  time, and I think how dated the whole thing is makes me nostalgic for a
  different time.]

- *V* by **Spock's Beard** - A very literal packaging of classic prog rock for
  the 21st century. I can almost picture these guys sitting down to make "Great
  Nothing" and saying "OK boys, its time to make our 'Supper's Ready'". The whole
  thing has a kind of squeaky clean, Christian rock vibe to it that is both
  cringey and effective somehow. [*Memory*: I came across this during my
  deep dive exploration of prog rock circa 2003. This was by far the highest
  rated neo-prog album on RateYourMusic, and it deserves the good reviews.]
  
- *Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2)* by **XTC** - Few great bands have closed
  out their career this well. It is a solid set of straight-ahead songs
  that shows off how easy it was for these guys to make pop perfection. There is
  no bombast or orchestration here, and shows off the core of what made this
  band great for over two decades. [*Memory*: When I first got into **XTC** in
  2004, this was the new record. It wasn't yet clear that it would be the last
  one. I always hoped we would get more.]
