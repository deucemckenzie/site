2023 Albums
-----------

For the first time, I find myself a full year behind in adding to the modern day
releases here. Partially, this is because I have been distracted with other
hobbies (most notably a return to both running and bowling) but also because I
kept hoping that additional releases might join those listed below. It seems
like things have lost momentum a bit from the pandemic years, but that might be
just because I have more going on my life now, and less time to focus on Animal
Crossing and pop music like some sort of teenager. Every one of the albums comes
from an artist that already had one (or more) in my lists of past years. Have I
permanently slipped into the backward focussed attention of middle age? Or is
this just a dry spell before a go in a totally new direction. Since I am a year
behind on this project, I already know the answer, and can now say it is a bit
of both.

- *Did You Know There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd* by **Lana Del Rey** - Not
  quite as amazing as the last three records, but that is a fairly high
  standard. The weird interludes break up the album in a way that detracts from
  the songs, and there are a couple weaker than usual tunes. That said, the
  title song, "Paris, Texas", and "Peppers" stand among her finest work. The
  biggest surprise is the return of the hip hip inclinations of her debut in a
  way that we haven't heard in some time. This isn't the full album statement we
  have come to expect, but is still way above what most artists are producing
  today. [*Memory*: In February/March of 2024 I was walking before work, working
  my way back from a prolonged knee injury. This album fit well with the chilly
  pre-dawn mornings.]

- *i/o* by **Peter Gabriel** - A theme of the last few years has been
  unexpectedly strong releases from legacy artists that have done very little
  for the last decade or two. In the case of this record, the artist has
  returned to doing exactly what they have always done, and did it extremely
  well. This fits in cleanly with the sound of the records that preceded it, and
  manages to be his best work since the third of the self-titled albums. I hope
  he makes more music, but if not, the strangely positive "Live and Let Live" is
  the perfect note for one of the all time greats to say goodbye on. [*Memory*:
  There are two different mixes of this albums, and I needed to pick my favorite
  when I bought my vinyl copy. It was tough but I went with the dark-side mix
  that I prefer by the thinnest of margins.]

- *I Inside the Old Year Dying* by **PJ Harvey** - Polly's transition to and
  English folk musician, combined with 21st century Kate Bush dance technique is
  complete. In all seriousness, this a very different place from where she
  started, but amazing in its own unique way. We continue to get a combination
  of the latter day "church voice" vocals and the old-school growling
  techniques. The music also seems to pull from the full history of her catalog.
  The mood of the record is however very consistent from start to finish with a
  haunting, claustrophobic sound. Her only other record that sounds anything
  like this is *White Chalk* but even that connection is tenuous and brief. One
  thing she will never do is repeat herself. [*Memory*: I saw her in concert in
  Toronto in September of 2024. The performance included the entirety of this
  record played in sequence, followed by a selection of back catalog material.
  It was delightful and somewhat shocking to hear this wonderful album played
  side by side with the older material which for the most part, felt like the
  work of an entirely different artist.]

- *Fantasy Something* by **Hooray for Earth** - [**2023 FAVORITE**] - Even though
  this is essentially the work of a single person, I was still shocked by the
  sudden revival of this project. I thought for sure that Noel Heroux had moved
  on from this kind of thing, and I was overjoyed to hear the most complex and
  accomplished work thus far released under this name. This isn't easy music,
  and it almost demands that someone has been listening since the first release
  of the project, but for those of us who have been, the combination of glitchy
  samples and churchlike melodies is the perfect next step. Let's hope it's not
  the last. [*Memory*: He did a bandcamp fundraiser for a vinyl physical release
  of this, which unfortunately didn't succeed. For a moment I considered
  offering to front the remaining needed funds to make the pressing happen.]

- *The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We* by **Mitski** - A scaling back after
  the big, risk-taking of the last album was inevitable. The public had decided
  the last release was a bit much, and the artist obliged with a more
  straightforward, but still very enjoyable alt-folk record. The strong
  songwriting ensures that it still works, even if I would prefer a bit more of
  the risks from the last record. [*Memory*: I bought this on physical media not
  knowing a thing about it since I enjoyed the last album so much. I learned to
  appreciate this more subtle statement after time. Would I have done so if I
  only streamed it?]

- *Personal Duty* by **Space Art** - These guys went from zero to one of my
  all-time favorites in the space of a few weeks (more on this when I get to the
  70s/80s). Then the last original member passed away leaving this last album as
  a final statement. The same wonderful combination of vintage synths and drums
  as the classic records, this time with some modern production values that
  sound a little like **Daft Punk** and the other artists that obviously owe a
  great debt to their work. It all works amazingly well, except for the strange
  "Goree Island" which feels a little too unserious for the very serious subject
  matter it is taking on. [*Memory*: I imported this on vinyl directly from the
  French label that put it out. I only wish I had done it a bit earlier to get
  an autograph by the artist, who isn't around to sign further copies.]

- *Javelin* by **Sufjan Stevens** - My favorite record of his since the
  legendary *Illinois*, now we are back to the kind of experimentation that he
  does best. The first song "Evergreen" almost seems to lure in the more casual
  listeners who came onboard with the more straightforward folk of *Carrie and
  Lowell*, and then takes an abrupt left turn that makes the glitchiness of *The
  Age of Adz* seem tame. From there it feels like a summary of why Sufjan is one
  of the greatest musicians working today. [*Memory*: Sufjan had always kept the
  issue of his sexuality ambiguous. This album and the accompanying promotional
  tour changed that in the very saddest way possible.]
