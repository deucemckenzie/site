1999
----

I guess if this project had a very beginning it would be this year. Sometime in
early 2000 I would assemble a mix CD of what I considered to be the best songs
of the prior year. I had recently bought my first CD burner, and one application
I was very excited about was the ability to create compilations that I could
listen to on the Sony Discman that was hooked into a casette adapter in my car.
It was a highly manual process that required me to insert and remove twelve
different albums as each track was added to the CD-R. So what was on
this disc, and how does it hold up 23 years later?

It could be way worse! Nine of the sixteen tracks come off of five albums that
are still among my favorites from the year. A further four songs make the list
of my favorite tracks off of records that are not on my album list. That means
that only three tracks have dropped off my radar completely, and they are a
study in how my taste has changed over time.

- "No Leaf Clover" by **Metallica** - I don't know that any other band has aged
  less gracefully than these guys. What used to seem so edgy and hard, now comes
  across as tacky and commercial. At the time I liked this track enough for it
  to kick off the whole comp, but today it feels dated and boring.

- "Higher" by **Creed** - This isn't awful by any means, and it probably still
  ranks as one of their best songs. In general I have no taste for the post
  grunge sound anymore. There are a few selections on the list below that are
  adjacent to this kind of thing, but I just can't take all those distorted
  droning guitars anymore.

- "The Chemicals Between Us" by **Bush** - Listening to this song again, it is a
  bit more interesting than I remember. The structure is fairly ambitious for a
  late 90s alt rock song, and it seems to be alluding to break beats in its
  rhythms. That said, this band suffers from a bad case of crappy 90s guy
  vocalist.

I didn't even own all the albums and had to borrow two of them from a friend to
complete the playlist. This revealed to me another use of the CD burner, piracy.
For the next several years I would use this means to expand my collection beyond
what my current wealth could achieve. It was the age of music piracy after-all.
I had been experimenting with MP3 downloads for the last year or so when
high-speed internet all of a sudden made them way more practical. I remember
sitting in the computer lab of Penn State Berks campus filling up a 100 MB zip
disk a couple dozen tracks from Napster. Looking back, I wasn't really
interested in pirating music, I just wanted a sample top make informed
decisions. We were using Napster like we use Spotify today. Regardless, by 2003
legal music downloads were finally a thing and I went completely legit. It isn't
true of everyone, but I think the download era made me into the music consumer I
am today. I own 4000+ albums in different formats after-all.

Why was 1999 the first year when I decided to make a summing up of my favorites?
This was the dawn of the internet age, and there were a couple hand-crafted
websites out there already doing the same thing that surely were an
inspiration. For me though, it was something deeper. In late 1998 I had moved
out of my parents house. My summer internship was providing me a small amount of
discretionary income, and my discretion was to buy music. Specifically it was my
discretion to buy the music that interested me, all the music that interested
me for the first time in my life. Growing up in a conservative religious cult,
large swaths of pop music were considered evil, the work of "the Devil". I was
mentally out of that mindset for some years, but the physical separation gave me
the freedom to explore my genuine self. Nowhere was this more tangibly evident
than the music I was consuming. Is this why pop music is so important to me? Because
in many ways it was the first medium through which I expressed and explored my
genuine self? I'm glad that so many of my favorites from that time are still
something I enjoy today. They have however been joined by quite a few others.

- *To Venus and Back* by **Tori Amos** - Her last album of the 90s and the end
  of a period of massive artistic growth. It's not that Tori has stopped
  innovating after this one, but the rate of growing ambition slowed down a bit.
  The originals on disc 1 take the electronic infused sounds from *Choirgirl* to
  their logical and fulfilling conclusion. Some of the most exciting deep tracks
  that still show up at live shows are here, like "Josephine", "Suede", and
  especially "Lust". The closing track "1000 Oceans" seems to point towards the
  more straight ahead singer-songwriter material that would feature on the next
  few records. Disc 2 is a stunning capture of Tori at her live best. At the
  time it felt a little unnecessary, but today I'm glad we have this record of
  the earliest days of full band Tori Amos performance practice. [*Memory*: This
  is the first of three records on this list that came out the same exact day:
  September 21, 1999. I'll never forget heading to the Best Buy by my college
  with a list of records to pick up. I was particularly interested in this one
  as I had been buying the CD singles that had been released in advance of this
  record. Each one seemed to be better than the one that came before. I remember
  leaving the Wyomissing Boarders with a CD single of "1000 Oceans" and having
  it unwrapped and ready to go in the discman by the time I got to my car. The
  album did not disappoint. Soon after Tori would go on her dual headlining tour
  with Alanis. I remember discussing with one of my work colleagues a plan to
  somehow split the ticket to the Philly show, since we each only cared about
  one of the artists.]

- *When the Pawn...* by **Fiona Apple** - Still my favorite record by her. The
  eccentricity that would define her later work is starting to form, but has yet
  to become grating. Certainly not a commercial record by any means, and it
  pretty much destroyed her career for almost two decades. [*Memory*: This is
  one of those records that I assumed that I would never own on vinyl. Thanks to
  the success of *Fetch the Bolt Cutters* we got a really nice repress on Vinyl
  Me Please in 2021. It cracks me up that they left the pretentiously long title
  off the cover this time. I have to assume she is mildly embarrassed about that
  as an adult.]

- *Euphoria Morning* by **Chris Cornell** - A bit of a lost classic. After the
  horrors of **Audioslave** and his later solo career it can be easy to forget
  about this nice little 60s rock inspired record. In the late 90s it seemed
  like every aging alt-rocker was leaning heavily on the psych-rock of their
  youth. This was a nice showcase of his voice in a set of more low key
  material. If only we had gotten more of this. [*Memory*: The second record on
  this list from 21 September 1999. I was a fan of **Soundgarden** and enjoyed
  his contribution to the **Great Expectations Soundtrack** and was very
  interested in what his solo career would hold. I was very pleased with this
  disc and the solo show I caught later in 1999 at the Tower Theater. After
  that, I can't say I enjoyed his work.]

- *Implode* by **Front Line Assembly** - The beginning of their second phase.
  Elements of techno and other modern electronic music are really starting to
  creep in. This is massively danceable. The world music sounds of their other
  act **Delerium** are also showing up more often. As an adult this is probably
  my favorite of theirs. [*Memory*: I bought this on a bit of a whim during a
  period of high interest in the **Delerium** project. In many ways, this was my
  point of entry to the goth sounds.]

- *Slow Riot for Zero Kanada* by **Godspeed You! Black Emperor** - Very much in
  the sound of their debut LP, this EP is the perfect fit for when you want just
  a taste of the **Godspeed**. Yeah it all sounds very much the same in
  retrospect, but I like that sound. [*Memory*: IN 2021, when I was chasing down my
  favorites from the past to make my vinyl collection as complete as I could, I
  waffled on how much I really needed this. It ended up being the last record I
  bought during that project.]

- *The 3 Way* by **Lilys** - An interesting band that did a bunch of different
  things, and released a ton of albums very quickly. I sought them all out, but
  my favorite will always be this **Kinks** homage. The way that it fuses the
  sounds from those late 60s records with the spirit of 90s indie is a magic
  combination. [*Memory*: This was fairly obscure when I became aware of it in
  the mid-2000s. I remember buying a used copy off of Amazon that didn't even
  have the front cover booklet. I now own an amazing 2019 vinyl pressing that I
  am amazed got made.]

- *Christmas* by **Low** - A remarkable holiday album that feels like an
  incredibly natural thing for this band to create. It is warm and sad, and
  complicated. It really captures the feeling of the holiday season for me and a
  lot of other folks who consider it their seasonal favorite. [*Memory*: Around
  2019 I started to compile a playlist of holiday music that captured the way
  the season felt to me. I discovered this record when researching potential
  candidates to add.]
