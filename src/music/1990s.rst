1990s Overview
--------------
Maybe the most diverse and unique decade I will catalog in this project. When it
started, the prevailing trends were mostly a carryover of the dominant sounds of
the 80s. Then grunge and the alternative rock movement took hold. The influences
of world music and multiculturalism were undeniable. Rap/Hip-hop emerged from
the underground and became the dominant cultural force. Then it morphed with
R&B and Rock to create new genres that would spawn the most popular groups of
the later half of the decade. Throughout all the trends, women were increasingly
taking the lead in driving trends and record sales. It was an exciting and
positive time, yet in many ways it was the end of the world as we knew it. By
the end of the decade, the music industry would be transformed by a series of
technological developments and we would never consume music the same way again.

These were my teenage years, and like any good teenager, I was a music
obsessive. I spent the early years very much looking backward into the artists
of the classic rock period. As things continued, I became very wrapped up in the
diverse sounds of the age. There was a lot going on over the course of these ten
years and this section took a long time to write. It was an enjoyable and
nostalgic journey, and I'm glad I could write these memories down while I can
still recall them clearly.

*Favorite Song*:

"Iieee" by **Tori Amos**

Is the title of this song "No" in Japanese? I'm not sure, but this might just be
the most outstanding piece of art-rock by an musician who has made a lot of
pretty outstanding art-rock.
