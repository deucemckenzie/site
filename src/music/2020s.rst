Still a work in progress. The pandemic has put a huge damper on everything, and
music isn't immune. Artists aren't able to tour and album releases have been far
fewer. The isolation and extra time has created some fairly introspective
records. It also gave me the time to make serious progress on this project.


2020
----

The lost year. The most historic year most people now living will experience. A
massive pandemic that impacted everything. A relationship ended, an exciting new
one began. I changed jobs from one I loved, to a new one I loved more. I had
more free time that I have ever had as an adult. I didn't hear a whole lot of
new music I loved, though I certainly tried. I'm still mostly getting into
albums by artists I already know well.

- *The Loves of Your Life* by **Hamilton Leithouser** - I've enjoyed each of his three
  solo records released to date, but each one sounds more and more like his old
  band *The Walkmen* and I'm not going to complain. I loved *The Walkmen*.
  [*Memory*: Being excited there was any new music to listen to during the pandemic]

- *McCartney III* by **Paul McCarney** - In the depths of early pandemic anxiety I
  was really excited to hear about the third in the series of McCarney's self
  titled records. I and II had been some of Paul's most experimental and
  groundbreaking work. I pre-ordered on vinyl the day it was announced. It
  managed to be better than I thought it could be. I listened again when I wrote
  this, and realize I am still liking it more with each listen. It is remarkable
  that he can make music like this at his age and career state. [*Memory*: Hearing
  that this existed was welcome good news in one of the roughest periods of my life]

- *Tomorrows I* by **Son Lux** - [**2020 FAVORITE**] Another welcome distraction
  in the lost year was the
  three part epic by Ryan Lott and band. The albums play out more like films in
  a trilogy than a multi-movement musical piece. This one does a great job
  setting up the themes and concepts of the whole work. [*Memory*: This was
  released right after I moved back to Rochester] 

- *Tomorrows II* by **Son Lux** - If part one was A New Hope, this definitely is
  Empire Strikes Back. Everything is shaken up and broken apart. The reviews I
  saw didn't like this one. I don't think we were supposed to be comfortable. This is the
  middle act in the trilogy when things get harsh and difficult. [*Memory*:
  Being very disappointed with this until part III resolved everything]

- *The Ascension* by **Sufjan Stevens** - I'm glad that Sufjan is back to making weird
  music, that is when he is at his best. [*Memory*: For some reason I listened
  to my vinyl copy of this  for the first time while watching a video of my high 
  school class Promenade on Facebook]

- *It is What it Is* by **Thundercat** - Not as perfect at his previous record *Drunk* but
  still an amazing record on the boundaries of R&B and jazz. [*Memory*: I spent
  a really long time deciding if I really needed a copy of this on vinyl,
  apparently I did]

2021
----
This is the first year that was compiled with this project in progress, and in
mind. How did this impact my listening? The impact is subtle, but I'm sensing an
effort to branch out and hear new things (that aren't just random things I'm
hearing on NPR). By the time 2021 ended, I had been working from home for
almost two years. I'm also seeing the kind of introspective music that fit in
well with that kind of isolation. I also feel the effect the pandemic on a sense
of isolation and self reflection in many of the records I was listening to.

- *The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows* by **Damon Albarn** - I
  really didn't like this the first time I heard it, but it really grew on me.
  Such a pretty, subtle record. [*Memory*: I liked this record well enough to
  seek out a vinyl copy, and it was really only after the first listen that way
  that I really connected with this one, especially the last few tracks.]

- *Ocean to Ocean* by **Tori Amos** - Another really strong record, from an
  artist who keeps making them. Probably not as good as *Native Invader* but the
  song "Spies" is her best in a decade or more. [*Memory*: Tori came to
  Rochester for the first time in about 20 years on this tour and played a great
  show to a very engaged audience.]

- *Cavalcade* by **Black Midi** - My favorite artist discovery in some years.
  (More than a decade maybe?). Some serious prog/math rock made with an indie spirit.
  So pretty, so dense, so much to wrap your head around. The kind of music that
  only makes sense to people with hundreds of favorite records, and hand craft a
  website to talk about them. [*Memory*: buying the LP online before I had even
  heard half the album because I was so taken]

- *Jubilee* by **Japanese Breakfast** - We are now getting to the point where
  music is starting to sound like a retro throwback to the indie music I
  listened to in my college days. This is the kind of semi-twee indie pop that I
  loved 20 years ago, updated with the electronic sounds of our current age.
  [*Memory*: Around this time, It felt like every time Spotify radio took over
  after the music I actually chose to play, it played me the song "Paprika". Did
  this make me like the album by brute force?]

- *Chemtrails Over the Country Club* by **Lana Del Rey** - *NFR* wasn't a fluke,
  but the beginning of a career on a whole new level. This is another extraordinary
  album filled with the old Lana tricks and a killer folk soul. The songwriting
  is top notch, and the performances are first rate. My favorite artist working
  today. [*Memory*: It had been about five years since I had heard an album on
  vinyl for my first listen, and I was glad I saved this one]

- *Blue Banisters* by **Lana Del Rey** - How is this even better than her first
  album from 2021. How is she the most consistent artist of the current
  generation? What is the next album going to be like? Is it coming out this
  year too? [*Memory*: Being extremely confused about what this was when it was
  announced a few weeks after *Chemtrails*]
  
- *Solar Power* by **Lorde** - Yes, this is a much subtler record with less lofty
  themes and goals. We live in an age where subtlety doesn't get the credit it
  deserves. This is a great record. Don't worry, I'm sure she will be back to
  some real melodrama someday soon. [*Memory*: For the second straight record I
  hated the lead single when I heard it, but I love the album (and ended up
  liking the lead single in time)]

- *Hey What* by **Low** - [**2021 FAVORITE**] When I became aware that these
  guys were making somewhat avant garde electronic music now, I had to hear it.
  Sure enough the beautiful harmonies were now backed by a super interesting and
  downright pretty interpretation of minimalist industrial. Are they really
  Mormons? Surely music this good must be sinful? [*Memory*: In a repeating
  theme this year, I bought a vinyl copy of this midway through my first listen]

- *Tomorrows III* by **Son Lux** - Continuing my Star Wars analogy from last
  year, this is most definitely "Return of the Jedi" and "Embrace" is "Yub Nub"
  brining the whole thing home with a positive vibe, looking back on the themes
  that run through this amazing trilogy. [*Memory*: Streaming this first thing
  the morning it was released and feeling so satisfied by how the trilogy ended]

- *The Future Bites* by **Steven Wilson** - I dig the sterile, anxious vibe of
  this record, even if the songs aren't universally brilliant. Certainly music
  for our current age. The singles "KING GHOST" and "PERSONAL SHOPPER" are
  killer. Who here is surprised that this guy has changed sounds again?
  [*Memory*: The creepy video for "PERSONAL SHOPPER" is all I can think of when
  I hear this album]

2022

Compiling my favorites here as they happen.

- *WE* by **The Arcade Fire** - Now this is more like it! I'm not sure what was
  going on during their prior record, but this is a massive improvement. Yes,
  there is some truth to the favorite joke that this sounds like the band trying
  to pay homage to their younger selves, but they are doing a great job! Best
  case scenario continues to be this band slowly morphing into Bruce
  Springsteen in the decades to come. [*Memory*: The first time I streamed the
  "Lightning I" single it was an exciting moment. Not quite like hearing
  "Sprawl II" for the first time, but the kind of joy only these guys can bring
  up.]

- *Once Twice Melody* by **Beach House** - It has become clear that all their
  records will be great, but some are greater than others. This is one of the
  top tier releases. More dreamy dream pop than we have seen since *Teen Dream*
  but with the crisp, first rate song-craft of a veteran who have mastered their
  art. [*Memory*: This was released in four 4-5 song increments, I ordered the
  deluxe vinyl box after the first play of the first batch.]

- *Ants From Up There* by **Black Country, New Road** - I'm always a little
  suspicious when something is so universally loved. Everyone from Amazon to
  RateYourMusic seems to think this is the consensus album of the year. When I
  listened to it, I was shocked that something like this was getting such wide
  acclaim. It reminds me of **Black Midi**, **Frightened Rabbit**, and **Thee
  Silver Mt Zion** (?!). I guess this is what the kids like now. [*Memory*: I
  really connected with this album for the first time on a walk around the Park
  Avenue neighborhood, particularly the song "Snow Globes".]

- *Imperium* by **Ghost** - They have changed the sound a bit again, but still a
  great record. Not as long lasting as their last two releases, but I still had
  a great time with this. "Darkness at the Heart of My Love" is a particularly
  interesting new direction for these guys. [*Memory*: I ordered a vinyl copy of
  this record before I heard a single song off of it. That is the faith I have
  at this point.]

- *Magnificent Bird* by **Gabriel Kahane** - The stellar folk song-craft we have
  seen in the prior records, with some interesting new elements and instruments.
  "Linda & Stuart" reminds me of Owen Pallett in a very favorable way. The title
  track feels like Gabe's take on the Sufjan formula, and it really works out.
  [*Memory*: I heard this record for the first time on vinyl, and I listened to
  it three times in a row.]

- *Ghost Song* by **Cecile McLorin Salvant** - I generally don't like vocal
  jazz, but I really like this. A great record of originals with a striking
  cover of **Kate Bush**'s "Wuthering Heights". [*Memory*: In 2022 I
  resubscribed to SiriusXM for the first time in about 15 years. Early on in the
  pandemic they offered free streaming, and it eventually made me join back up
  again. I heard the title track from this album on their jazz station and was
  really struck by it. ]

- *Laurel Hell* by **Mitski** - I had enjoyed several of her prior records,
  particularly *Puberty 2* but they were never consistent enough to make my
  list of favorites. I seem to like this one more than most folks. There is
  something about the use of piano and the dense arrangements that really speak
  to me. This is still a bit front loaded, but that first side is amazing.
  [*Memory*: This was another discovery on the satellite radio. The Indie
  channel was playing "Stay Soft" about every half hour and I was glad to hear
  it.]
