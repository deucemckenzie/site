Still a work in progress. The pandemic has put a huge damper on everything, and
music isn't immune. Artists aren't able to tour and album releases have been far
fewer. The isolation and extra time has created some fairly introspective
records. It also gave me the time to make serious progress on this project.


2020
----

The lost year. The most historic year most people now living will experience. A
massive pandemic that impacted everything. A relationship ended, an exciting new
one began. I changed jobs from one I loved, to a new one I loved more. I had
more free time that I have ever had as an adult. I didn't hear a whole lot of
new music I loved, though I certainly tried. I'm still mostly getting into
albums by artists I already know well.

- *The Loves of Your Life* by **Hamilton Leithouser** - I've enjoyed each of his three
  solo records released to date, but each one sounds more and more like his old
  band *The Walkmen* and I'm not going to complain. I loved *The Walkmen*.

- *McCartney III* by **Paul McCarney** - In the depths of early pandemic anxiety I
  was really excited to hear about the third in the series of McCarney's self
  titled records. I and II had been some of Paul's most experimental and
  groundbreaking work. I pre-ordered on vinyl the day it was announced. It
  managed to be better than I thought it could be. I listened again when I wrote
  this, and realize I am still liking it more with each listen. It is remarkable
  that he can make music like this at his age and career state.

- *Tomorrows I* by **Son Lux** - Another welcome distraction in the lost year was the
  three part epic by Ryan Lott and band. The albums play out more like films in
  a trilogy than a multi-movement musical piece. This one does a great job
  setting up the themes and concepts of the whole work.

- *Tomorrows II* by **Son Lux** - If part one was A New Hope, this definitely is
  Empire Strikes Back. Everything is shaken up and broken apart. The reviews I
  saw didn't like this one. I don't think we were supposed to be comfortable. This is the
  middle act in the trilogy when things get harsh and difficult.

- *The Ascension* by **Sufjan Stevens** - I'm glad that Sufjan is back to making weird
  music, that is when he is at his best.

- *It is What it Is* by **Thundercat** - Not as perfect at his last record *Drunk* but
  still an amazing record on the boundaries of R&B and jazz.

- *Cavalcade* by **Black Midi** - My favorite artist discovery in some years.
  (More than a decade maybe?). Some serious prog/math rock made with an indie spirit.
  So pretty, so dense, so much to wrap your head around. The kind of music that
  only makes sense to people with hundreds of favorite records, and hand craft a
  website to talk about them.

- *Chemtrails Over the Country Club* by **Lana Del Rey** - *NFR* wasn't a fluke,
  but the beginning of a career on a whole new level. This is another extraordinary
  album filled with the old Lana tricks and a killer folk soul. The songwriting
  is top notch, and the performances are first rate. My favorite artist working
  today.
  
- *Solar Power* by **Lorde** - Yes, this is a much subtler record with less lofty
  themes and goals. We live in an age where subtlety doesn't get the credit it
  deserves. This is a great record. Don't worry, I'm sure she will be back to
  some real melodrama someday soon.

- *Tomorrows III* by **Son Lux** - Continuing my Star Wars analogy from last
  year, this is most definitely "Return of the Jedi" and "Embrace" is "Yub Nub"
  brining the whole thing home with a positive vibe, looking back on the themes
  that run through this amazing trilogy.

- *The Future Bites* by **Steven Wilson** - I dig the sterile, anxious vibe of
  this record, even if the songs aren't universally brilliant. Certainly music
  for our current age. The singles "KING GHOST" and "PERSONAL SHOPPER" are
  killer. Who here is surprised that this guy has changed sounds again?
