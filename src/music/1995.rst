1995
----

Even as a child, I felt pretty connected to the pop music of the day, and that
would intensify as teenager. That said, 1995 was probably the most out of step I
would ever be with the music that was being released. I was very much looking
back to the sounds of the 60s and 70s and could barely care about the hits of
the day. The year that I started high school, I was way more interested in
classic rock radio than I was the modern rock most of my peers were listening
to. I missed some classic records that I would only discover in retrospect,
including my favorites below.+

- *Fun Trick Noisemaker* by **The Apples in Stereo** - I'm a much bigger fan of
  the latter day, **ELO** tinged incarnation of this band. I like the earlier
  garage pop version as well, but this is really the only record from that era
  that stands out for me. I feel like they had things right on this first
  record, and spent the next 5-6 trying to recreate that sound. I also feel like
  the amateur production values here suit the music better than the more
  elaborate productions that were to come. [*Memory*: When this got reissued on
  vinyl, it was the moment that I realized I would have the opportunity to own
  the large majority of my favorites on that format.]

- *The Great Escape* by **Blur** - The record where they fully embrace their
  jaunty, hyper-English side. What was hinted at on *Parklife* takes full form
  here. They must have been such a cheerful, brightly colored alternative to the
  other BritPop offerings of the day. It would all change again after this of
  course, but this will always be what they do best in my opinion. I like some
  of the latter day singles, but this is pretty much my off-ramp for this band.
  [*Memory*: These guys barely made a dent in the USA, and at this point, they
  were almost completely unknown. I can only imagine how much my Beatlemaniac
  self would have loved this at the time. There was no internet to know about
  this kind of thing back then!]

- *Outside* by **David Bowie** - Peak 90s Bowie, and the work of an artist who
  was still working very hard to innovate while capturing the spirit of the
  current age. This is "art installation music" and modernist in that very 1990s
  kind of way. This is the music of the early internet age. It is also still
  very much a **David Bowie** record, and a great one at that. I didn't really
  connect with this as much as his classic work back then, but not believe it to
  stand among his very finest work. [*Memory*: In the late 90s I was a huge
  Bowie fan, and I worked with another "music person" who only really liked this
  record of his. We listened to it a bunch back then at work, but I just didn't
  get it back then.]

- *Alien Lanes* by **Guided By Voices** - The second (and final) record from
  their peak era. A collection of perfect little lowfi pop gems, they would
  never quite capture this again. [*Memory*: Back in the early days of Pandora,
  it played "Game of Pricks" for me, and I was instantly hooked.]

- *To Bring You My Love* by **PJ Harvey** - An interesting era for Polly Jean.
  She dialed up the glam and amped up the rock, yet kept the essential character
  that made the first two records so interesting. Its odd that this was such a
  commercial breakthrough, but anything seemed possible in the mid-90s. As fast
  as these changes came, they would be gone and replaced with something else
  that was new and wonderful. [*Memory*: I never liked this one as much as what
  came before and after. When the vinyl reissue series happened in the 2020
  time frame, I thought long and hard about if I needed to add this one. I got
  them all, and wow I am glad that I did.]

- *Wowee Zowee* by **Pavement** - This is one of those times that I do not agree
  with the crowd. This is almost universally considered their masterpiece. I
  like it, but it is a little too long. There is a great single album here, but
  not everything needed to make the cut. I think the albums before an after are
  sharper statements, and have better focus in the playful and more series
  sounds that proceeded and followed this one. That said, It is a still another
  great record that I enjoy listening to, just not as much as those others.
  [*Memory*: There was a used copy of this that sat on the counter at City
  Lights records for years. I considered buying it, but never did. I never owned
  a physical copy of this until the circa 2010 vinyl reissues that Matador did.]

- *Different Class* by **Pulp** - I did't know about this music in the 90s, but
  if I did, I would have loved it. Like many American youth of the time, I was
  attracted to the brightness of English rock music that was a big contrast with
  the murky post-grunge of the day. This has those wonderful dance elements that
  you needed to look across the pond to find. It also has the high quality
  songwriting that blows away the knuckle-draggers that were dominating the
  radio in the US. [*Memory*: I became aware of these guys and this album when
  William Shatner's cover of "Common People" was making the rounds in the 2003
  time frame. What a strange point of entry, but regardless I'm glad I found my
  way.]

- *The Bends* by **Radiohead** - With how inventive of a guitarist Jonny
  Greenwood is, It is a real shame that this is their last album as a guitar
  based act. While the guitars would make their appearances in what came after,
  this is the last time they had a staring role. A tremendous rock album, and a
  milestone of the BritPop movement. "My Iron Lung" will always be one of their
  best songs. [*Memory*: For years I tried to claim this my favorite of their
  records. I think I was just making some passive resistance to the rise of
  electronic rock in the early 2000s.]

- *Ocean Beach* by **Red House Painters** - I always feel a little guilty that I
  don't like the music that Mike Kozelek made after he got his life together, as
  what he was doing in his darker moments. That said, this pleasant airy folk
  rock record holds up well to his earlier work. Maybe it is because there is
  just enough melancholy in tracks like "Summer Dress". [*Memory*: In 2009 I
  spent some time as a tourist in San Francisco after a business trip to the
  region. I decided to do a "Red House Painters Walking Tour" where I visited
  all the places he name checked in the albums/songs, including Ocean Beach.]

- *Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness* by **Smashing Pumpkins** - [**1995
  FAVORITE**] - There have been quite a few bands in history that for a brief
  moment in time, managed to completely transcend themselves and make music that
  seems completely beyond what they should be capable of. Smashing Pumpkins
  1995-97 may be the most extreme case of this. A period of stunning creativity
  and productivity, these three years alone make them legends. This album is so
  over the top and wonderful from the little piano ditty it starts with, to the
  lyrically preposterous yet incredible "Bullet With Butterfly Wings", and what
  feels like countless amazing and blistering rock tunes. People who say
  *Siamese Dream* is better than this are crazy. [*Memory*: It's hard to
  separate this from *The Aeroplane Flies High*, which collected the singles and
  B-sides that were released in their glorious era. I actually loved that
  first.]
