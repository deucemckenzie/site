2015 Albums
-----------

I turned 35 in 2015, which sounded very old at the time. My relationship with
music was also making me feel old. I saw three bands this year: The Psychedelic
Furs, The Church, and The Chameleons. It was the year of 80s nostalgia I guess.
I was very much treading musical water, keeping in touch with the artists that
hadn't let me down in the past. That ended up working out really well in 2015,
as several of my favorites released their best work.

- *Depression Cherry* by **Beach House** - This was when the world caught up with
  what I already knew, these guys are one of the best bands currently working.
  It is a little strange that dream pop made by two people with fairly minimal
  instrumentation and fairly consistent production techniques has had such
  staying power. This is great record, and "Beyond Love" is my most favorite song of
  theirs among many favorites from them. [*Memory*: For some reason I had
  convinced myself before I hear it, that there was no way this was going to
  stand up to their earlier work. Wow, I was wrong.]
  
- *Thank Your Lucky Stars* by **Beach House** - Now, releasing two records after
  one another was some serious flexing. In my opinion, this one is even a little
  bit better. It certainly is a bit brighter in a way that I like. [*Memory*:
  Hearing that this existed and was the leftovers from the first album they made
  this year, and thinking there was no way it could be great. Wow, was I wrong.]

- *Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance* by **Belle and Sebastian** - Very solid an
  enjoyable, but the kind of record that made me wonder how much more they could
  milk the sound they had been working for the last decade plus. Sarah Marin's
  vocal contributions continue to carry the band a bit at this point. They
  needed to change after this, and they did. [*Memory*: When I played the first
  song on this record the first time, I realized it was the end of an era for
  these guys.]

- *Honeymoon* by **Lana Del Rey** - A very mellow left turn for Lana, this
  wasn't perfect by any means, but it was an important step in a different
  direction that she still is on as of 2021.

- *Meliora* by **Ghost** - [**2015 FAVORITE**] This is the record where the
  formula came together in
  a big way. It is amazing how something so satirical can also be such seriously
  great music. "He Is" is such a beautiful and stunningly produced mockery of
  christian rock. [*Memory*: One of the most fun shows I have ever been to in my
  life was seeing them at the Rochester Main Street armory on this tour]

- *Have You In My Wilderness* by **Julia Holter** - I have had a strange
  relationship with this record. I was exposed to the song "silhouette" by
  Spotify radio soon after it came out and loved it. I listened to only that
  song for years and never sought out the record. When I finally heard the whole
  album and loved it, I never checked out any of her other releases. I don't
  know why I am approaching this artist so cautiously. This is the kind of
  conservatory trained musician making complicated but highly melodic music
  thing that I love. Maybe someday I listen to something else she has done.
  *Memory*: I've streamed the song "silhouette" on Spotify more than almost any
  other song in existence]

- *Bones* by **Son Lux** - NPR's "favorite son" recruits some permanent members
  and becomes a real band. It was the best thing to ever happen to this project.
  This is nerd rock at its finest. A very strong concept record, this one to listen to from
  beginning to end. Still my favorite of theirs. [*Memory*:  I saw them at the Warhol 
  after this record, and that was the right kind of place to see this
  museum on the tour adventurous art rock.]

- *Carrie & Lowell* by **Sufjan Stevens** - I think there is a prevailing
  opinion that this is Sufjan's finest work. I'm glad he made this record so
  that the general public can understand the brilliance of this man, but I'm
  far happier that he immediately returned to making the weird stuff I like way
  more. Still a fine folk record with that Sufjan magic, but a bit too
  conservative to stand with his best work. [*Memory*: I almost didn't buy this
  on vinyl as it just wasn't "my kind of Sufjan" but I decided it has its time
  an place (and a place in my collection)]

- *Multi-Love* by **Unknown Mortal Orchestra** - They finally got it all to work
  together here. The delightfully funky electronic sound they occasionally got
  to work on their first two releases comes into focus here. Such a great
  sounding production as well, even though I'm pretty sure this is an analog
  home recording made in that little studio on the cover. [*Memory*: It took a
  while to realize I loved this whole album because I liked the first track so
  much, I never got to the later stuff]

- *Hand Cannot Erase* by **Steven Wilson** - A mellow prog rock concept record
  about an isolated person dying alone. Obviously intended to be sad and
  haunting, but also exceptionally beautiful. Feels like a massive upgrade to
  the Stupid Dream/Lightbulb Sun era **Porcupine Tree**. [*Memory*: Every now
  and then an album becomes a running playlist favorite despite not being in the
  typical genre for exercise. This is one of those for me.]

- *Vespers for a New Dark Age* by **Victoire** and **Missy Mazzoli**. The first
  Victoire record was a classically trained composer creating a rock band to
  make a very unusual kind of prog rock. This album is the composer using that
  band to play a contemporary classical work. In a way this albums felt like the
  end of "indie classical" and while I liked to scoff at the idea of the genre, it
  was a real and compelling thing for a while. The remix of "A Thousand Tongues" by the very
  much not a classical composer **Lorna Dune** feels like the last glorious
  moments of the spirit of classical music nerds forming rock bands. [*Memory*:
  I remember tweeting my enjoyment of the "A Thousand Tongues" remix and I could
  tell the artists generally appreciated the support]

- *The Epic* by **Kamasi Washington** - This is the most recent of my favorite
  albums that I do not own on vinyl, but easily could if I wanted to. I think it
  says a lot. I really like this triple album of modern jazz fusion, but I like
  his next record even more. There is nothing here that makes me need to own
  another quite epic release on vinyl, but I spin this one on Spotify often. The
  texture of this music is exceptional. [*Memory*: Hearing this and realizing
  what a consistent artist Washington is]
