2000s Single Songs
==================

This is the decade with the most albums, and by far the most favorite songs.

- "Lifelines" by **A-ha** - Another stunning bit of soft art-rock by the Norwegian
  masters. The chorus of this thing is something else.

- "Summer Moved On" by **A-ha** - And they proved they could big bombastic pop
  songs for the new millennium on their big comeback single.

- "Jessica" by **Adam Green** - I don't know that anything summarizes the break
  between mainstream pop and the indie creatives than this satire of Jessica Simpson.

- "Save Me" by **Aimee Mann** - I've still never seen "Magnolia" but I really
  like this song.

- "Lisa" by **Albert Hammond Jr** - I feel like this guy is wasting away in
  **The Strokes**. What a genius pop song.

- "Everyone Gets a Star" by **Albert Hammond Jr** - ditto, see above

- "Flip!" by **Apollo Sunshine** - There was a time when it looked like Philly
  was going to become an indie stronghold. We got this song and a few others.

- "Do the Whirlwind" by **Architecture In Helsinki** - Goofy childlike indie
  that I can't take for an entire album, but this song is great.

- "Again" by **Archive** - It is so strange how these guys had exactly one
  great song and it is a 16 minute art rock epic.

- "I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor" by **Arctic Monkeys** - The single
  that started it all for one of the greatest bands of the last 20 years.

- "Half Light" by **Athlete** - It is now trendy to call this kind of thing
  landfill indie, and I get it. There were some pretty good landfill indie songs though.

- "Elephant Gun" by **Beirut** - Their best song appears on an otherwise
  unspectacular EP. Gorgeous stuff.

- "The Model" by **Belle and Sebastian** - An amazing track off a generally
  mediocre record, with great shared vocals by Stuart and Stevie.

- "Your Cover's Blown" by **Belle and Sebastian** - Continuing the tradition of
  EP greatness, this is a look at the retro pop future for these guys.

- "The Hole in Me - Remastered" by **Blackfield** - The only high point from
  the three album output of this **Steven Wilson** light touch side project.

- "Red World" by **Blank Dogs** - I will always remember hearing this play at
  the gone but not forgotten Aquarius records in San Francisco, and walking out
  with a copy of the EP. The exact right kind of record to buy at that shop.

- "No Compass" by **Blank Dogs** - A delightful deconstruction of the **New
  Order** sound.

- "First Day of My Life" by **Bright Eyes** - At this point, he co-uldn't make a
  great album anymore, but there were always great songs.

- "Gold Mine Gutted" by **Bright Eyes** - see above

- "Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl" by **Broken Social Scene** - An
  extremely simple vocoder heavy vocal melody over a dense interesting
  instrumental background.

- "Liar" by **Built To Spill** - The later albums end up sounds more than a
  little like **Death Cab of Cutie** in a good way.

- "It Dawned on Me" by **Calla** - The kings of one great song per album, this
  was the first one I heard.

- "Fear Of Fireflies" by **Calla** - Why is the good song always the first one?

- "Tarantula" by **Calla** - Such a wonderful mysterious instrumental to start
  with, unfortunately they couldn't maintain this level.

- "The Greatest" by **Cat Power** - It is strange to see someone I used to love
  represented by only one song.

- "Signal Morning" by **Circulatory System** - I was so excited for a new album
  from these guys, but it only produced one great track.

- "I Believe" by **"Conjure One, Rhys Fulber"** - A very unexpected cover, and
  it is weird to hear the king of ambient industrial and world music fusion sing.

- "Pour Le Monde" by **Crowded House** - The best song you will ever hear play
  the background at CVS.

- "Tail & Mane" by **Cryptacize** - I saw them open for **St. Vincent** at Noise
  pop 2009 and the positive experience made me get very into them for a while.
  I'm left only with a lasting interest in this song.

- "Alice Practice" by **Crystal Castles** - So abrasive. I hated it at first,
  but wow did it grow on me.

- ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" by **Daft Punk** - I discoverd these guys
  from an Apple commercial and this song. Still really like this track, but I've
  never seen the record as the classic it is popularly thought to be.

- "Strange Overtones" by **David Byrne** - It was jarring for this duo who
  previously made wildly experimental music, to make such a stunning pop song.
  Those Eno backing vocals really complete the song.

- "College Town Boy" by **Dent May** - I can't abide this phase of his career
  anymore, but this is very funny enjoyable track. He should make a new version.

- "Precious" by **Depeche Mode** - Around this time I tended to assume they were
  going to be over the hill, but they kept making great tracks that sounded
  surprisingly modern.

- "White Flag" by **Dido** - I felt a bit silly at the time (less so now) about how
  much I like this syrupy adult contemporary track.

- "Brand New Day" by **Dizzee Rascal** - One of the more off genre things that
  Sirius Left of Center played was UK Hip Hop. This is a classic of that scene.

- "My Old Ways" by **Dr. Dog** - Another group I'm bored with at this point, but
  I still really like this one track.

- "Home" by **Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros** - Not as charming as it once
  was, but still a fun little pop song.

- "It's A Motherfucker" by **Eels** - I'm a huge fan of this guys lyrics and
  voice, and both are on display here.

- "1234" by **Feist** - Was that Ipod Video commercial when indie broke into the
  mainstream? 

- "My Moon My Man" by **Feist** - A terrific little jazzy pop song on an album
  that I otherwise mostly find boring.

- "Emerge" by **Fischerspooner** - Was there ever another artist in the genre of
  electroclash?

- "Mykonos" by **Fleet Foxes** - They are so overrated in my opinion, but each
  album has had one great song.

- "He Doesn't Know Why" by **Fleet Foxes** - ...and this is the best of them all.

- "Play the Hits" by **Hal** - The only other band that was doing anything like
  the delightful little pop of **The Thrills**.

- "Cinders" by **Holopaw** - A latter day slowcore act spices things up with a
  little brass.

- "Losing Light" by **Holopaw** - Really nice mellow mood on this one.

- "Boy From School" by **Hot Chip** - I much prefer their later work, but this
  is my favorite from the early records.

- "Bandages" by **Hot Hot Heat** - I've liked this song since 2003 and I'm not
  sure I have ever heard the album.

- "Nice to Know You" by **Incubus** - An early indie band that made it big with
  this one.

- "Pioneer To The Falls" by **Interpol** - Their best song on an otherwise
  unremarkable record.

- "Such Great Heights" by **Iron & Wine** - A song so good, it was an indie hit
  twice in two years.

- "Ruby" by **Kaiser Chiefs** - After their first record, these guys went very
  pop. It worked really well at times, like here.

- "Like It Too Much" by **Kaiser Chiefs** - My favorite of their later poppier
  records. Such a fun, interesting track.

- "A.D.I.D.A.S. (feat. Big Boi)" by **"Killer Mike, Big Boi"** - The best song
  from the electro-funk era of southern rap.

- "I'd Rather Dance With You" by **Kings of Convenience** - I don't know that I
  would need to read the bio to know these guys are Scandinavian.

- "Stutter" by **Lake Trout** - This band has so much potential, and their jazz
  influenced alt rock does a great job staying out of jam band territory.

- "Angelica" by **Lamb** - Yes I know this is mostly "Clair De Lune", but they
  do such a great job making it into a cool trip hop song.

- "Ain't Never Been Cool" by **Lucky Soul** - For a second it seemed like there
  was going to be an indie-pop revival of the early 60s sound, but this is one
  of the few interesting things to come out of it.

- "Sneffels Yokul" by **Make A Rising** - Every now and then NPR Music
  highlights something obscure and fascinating, and this is one of those.

- "Like U Crazy" by **Mates of State** - I saw these guys open for **Death Cab
  for Cutie** and came home with this, there most recent release. This goofy
  over the top love song is the only thing I still connect with from this silly
  husband/wife pop act.

- "Daylight" by **Matt and Kim** - This song was everywhere in 2009 and for good
  reason, it is a pop gem that combines an amazing piano hook with really
  interesting hip hop inspired drumming.

- "Golden Phone" by **Micachu & The Shapes** - This band was going to be the
  next big thing, but they really only left us with this great little eccentric
  pop song.

- "I can't Get You Out of My Head" by **Kylie Minogue** - I had a poster of the
  cover to her 2001 album *Fever* on my wall in undergrad. I could never
  convince anyone that it was because of my interest in the music contained within.

- "Study War" by **Moby** - A cool little latter day song by this guy, but at
  this point he was mostly mining his own past.

- "Dancefloors" by **My Morning Jacket** - A great little country rocker off a
  nearly great album.

- "Star Witness" by **Neko Case** - A great little dark country song that feels
  made for the NPR airwaves.

- "Aurora Borealis" by **Nesey Gallons** - An obscure Elephant6 gem from the
  height of my interest in the collective.

- "Right Where It Belongs" by **Nine Inch Nails** - I have never been able to
  get into their work after the 1990s, but this is the best of their later day
  songs. Perhaps because it sounds the most like something off of the 90s records.

- "Teen Creeps" by **No Age** - I'll never forget seeing them play this song at
  Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco at noise pop 2009.

- "I Was Never Young" by **of Montreal** - How I discovered them, when this was
  used in a TV commercial.

- "Breakfast in NYC" by **Oppenheimer** - Somehow these guys were super popular
  in State College, PA for a short period. This is a great little electronic
  indie-pop song.

- "Illuminate" by **Orbital** - The first CD I got from these guys was an early
  2000s compilation (found at a CD and Tape exchange in Cleveland) and a
  gravitated to this fairly straightforward pop song that doesn't really fit
  into the rest of their catalog. This really seems to anticipate the sound that
  **Daft Punk** was about to make big.

- "The Whole World (feat. Killer Mike)" by **"Outkast, Killer Mike"** - I didn't
  really take hip hop seriously and thought of it mostly as party music until I
  heard this amazing track.

- "This Is The Dream Of Win & Regine" by **Owen Pallett** - A terrific track of
  of his first record that gives indications of the brilliance to come.

- "Sleepyhead" by **Passion Pit** - What in the hell happened to the Pashy Pit?
  This song was so huge and they quickly disappeared.

- "Big Black Coffin" by **Peter Bjorn and John** - I love these stunning little
  sad pop songs these guys can make.

- "Nothing To Worry About" by **Peter Bjorn and John** - This albums was as
  weird departure and it really works on this one track.

- "Everything Is Everything" by **Phoenix** - They were more of a singles band
  for me and it felt like each album had one track that rose above the sameness
  of the other material.

- "Lisztomania" by **Phoenix** - See above

- "Bye Bye Bye" by **Plants and Animals** - Another time that NPR music
  highlighted a great track that would have otherwise not found an audience.
  This kind of indie folk was going out of style, but felt fresh here.

- "Hey Pretty" by **Poe** - An artist that I feel was never able to reach their
  full potential. A really cool rock song with electronic accents, and
  outstanding vocals. Not quite trip hop, but it fits in well with the sounds of
  the early 2000s.

- "Drawing the Line" by **Porcupine Tree** - The one great song off of their
  last album before hiatus. Much more of a straight ahead rock song than what
  these guys typically make.

- "Golden Touch - Full Length" by **Razorlight** - Might be "Landfill Indie" but
  it is good "Landfill Indie".

- "Lights Out" by **Santigold** - Such a great little power-pop gem.

- "Tear You Apart" by **She Wants Revenge** - Sirius was hyping the crap out of
  these guys, but this is really there only good song.

- "BlindBlindBlind" by **Silver Mt. Zion** - Bad singing has never sounded so
  good before or after.

- "Two Way Monologue" by **Sondre Lerche** - I was really into this guy back
  then, but this is about all I care to listen to these days.

- "Four to the Floor" by **Starsailor** - These guys take a break from generic
  slow rock to let Phil Spector make one last classic.

- "You Are The Blood" by **Sufjan Stevens** - A wild 10 minute epic that is peak
  weird Sufjan.

- "Punkrocker - feat. Iggy Pop" by **Teddybears** - A really cool Krautrock
  style song from a band that achieved nothing else.

- "A Minha Menina" by **The Bees** - A great cover that is almost to similar to
  the original, but still does enough new.

- "Go Karts" by **The Bees** - Their only weakness is how derivative everything
  seems. This Sgt. Pepper era Beatles homage works pretty well.

- "Velvet" by **The Big Pink** - Amazing song from a very mediocre album. The
  shoegazzey bridge in the middle is spectacular.

- "Cobalt Blue" by **The Church** - This was a very good latter day record, and
  this was an especially great track from it. Are they trying to make an **Echo
  and the Bunnymen** song?

- "Pass It On" by **The Coral** - Much like **The Bees**, their only weakness is
  their inability to separate themselves from their influences, but this is
  pretty great.

- "Dreaming of You" by **The Coral** - see above.

- "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" by **The Darkness** - You couldn't escape
  this song in 2004, but who would want to avoid this trashy rock fun.

- "No Cities Left" by **The Dears** - I generally have little interest in their
  early music other than this interesting song with a big sound that fits in
  well with their best work to come.

- ""The Gymnast, High Above the Ground"" by **The Decemberists** - Each of the
  first two records has a great song.

- "California One / Youth and Beauty Brigade" by **The Decemberists** - See above

- "Modern Moonlight" by **The Dresden Dolls** - The drumming in this song is
  some of the best punk small kit work I have ever seen or heard.

- "Don't Know Why (You Stay)" by **The Essex Green** - An obscure latter day E6
  pop gem.

- "Agenda Suicide" by **The Faint** - So stupid, but so enjoyable.

- "The W.A.N.D." by **The Flaming Lips** - The first song I ever liked by these
  guys, and probably still my favorite.

- "Dynamo" by **The Golden Dogs** - I don't know that another band has ever
  really sounded so much like **Paul McCarney and Wings** as these guys do here.

- "Who's Got The Crack" by **The Moldy Peaches** - A completely ridiculous joke
  of a song that totally works.

- "Girls" by **The Prodigy** - Some really interesting latter day techno that
  pulls in elements of the bass heavy electronic music of the day.

- "Phantom Limb" by **The Shins** - The one amazing track from the weak third album.

- "Dry Your Eyes" by **The Streets** - I do still like this jokey concept record
  though I rarely find myself returning to it, with the exception of this
  earnestly sincere closing track.

- "Seven Nation Army" by **The White Stripes** - Being played at every sporting
  event of the last 20 years has somehow not ruined this one.

- "Fell In Love With a Girl" by **The White Stripes** - Legos.

- "Experimental Film" by **They Might Be Giants** - Weirdly this latter day
  track was the song that got these guys on my radar.

- "Sweet the Sting" by **Tori Amos** - A terrific song off a horrible record.

- "Flowers In The Window" by **Travis** - Why did I like these guys so much?
  Well this song is pretty good.

- "Staring at the Sun" by **TV On The Radio** - I never liked these guys as much
  as everyone else, but their first album had some pretty good tracks.

- "Ambulance" by **TV On The Radio** - ...and this a capella track was best of all.

- "Oxford Comma" by **Vampire Weekend** - A clever little pop song from a band
  that would rapidly outlast their welcome.

- "Maps" by **Yeah Yeah Yeahs** - A very hot and cold band, but their high
  points are very high, like this stellar post-punk ballad.

- "Heads Will Roll" by **Yeah Yeah Yeahs** - One of the first shots fired in the
  80s revival, when the punk kids discovered keyboards and drum machines for the
  second time.
