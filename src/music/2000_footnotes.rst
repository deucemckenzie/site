**Albums that dropped off during the project**

- You know, I feel like I was always trying to convince myself that I liked **At
  The Drive In** and **The Mars Volta**. They made the images for 2000, 2003,
  and 2005, but didn't make the cut as I really tried to engage with those
  records. I think it is the kind of music I like, but executed in a way that I
  don't really care for. Too screamo for me.

Always with an Eye to the Past
------------------------------

When the decade started, I was still mostly looking into the music of the past.
As the years went on I continued to explore decades gone by, but simultaneous
to many artists and albums of the current age. In many cases there was a lot of
crossover between the two threads.

- **Genesis/Prog** - For most of my young life the early **Genesis** was as
  mysterious thing. I had often heard whispers of a very different band led by
  **Peter Gabriel** that was far more experimental than the 80s version I knew
  well. In the late 90s my brother had acquired a compilation of the band that
  included a couple songs from this era, and I was intrigued by the version of
  "The Carpet Crawlers" that closed out that record. In 2022 I would finally
  take the plunge and buy *The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway* knowing only
  "Crawlers" and the title song. It would open the door to one of my favorite
  bands. With the aid of Columbia House, I would go from zero to almost the
  entire catalog within a matter of months. Fourteen of these records make my
  list of all-time favorites, third most among all artists. In the early 2000s I
  kept my latest purchases in one of those leather bound CD wallets. I remember
  leafing through the book and showing my girlfriend what I was listening to,
  and her making fun of me mercilessly for all the **Genesis** records.
  Progressive rock will never be cool, but Genesis was my point of entry into
  the genre of **Rush**, **Yes**, **King Crimson** and many of my other favorite
  bands. It also was the purview of one of my favorite artists of the time
  **Porcupine Tree** / **Steven Wilson**.

- **UK Artists/The Kinks/The Jam/Blur** - It was a common thing for 90s
  teenagers to be Anglophiles, obsessed with UK music and culture. Much of this
  was centered around 60s bands like **The Beatles**. I was very much of this
  disposition and the interest continued and grew in my 20s. Early in the decade
  I had heard a sampling of **Kinks** tracks from the early "All Day, and All of the
  Night" (in a TV commercial) to "Lola" (a staple of classic rock radio) and I
  wanted to hear more. I remember an extensive search to find a comprehensive
  compilation that finally resulted in a two disc import collection that I found
  at the State College Circuit City around 2002. That disc provided me more
  enjoyment that I ever could have imagined and would be highly influential in
  my tastes going forward. A couple years later I heard the **Jam** track "Thats
  Entertainment" when streaming UK Virgin radio in my grad student office. I was
  intrigued that there was another band that like **The Kinks** were much more
  popular in the UK and had a mysterious catalog that I needed to know more
  about. Almost simultaneously, I had acquired a greatest hits compilation for
  the more contemporary band **Blur**, who also seemed defined by their
  "Britishness". This trilogy of "very English bands" would become central in my
  listening interests through the decade, and throughout my life since. These
  classic UK bands were obviously highly influential on the UK indie acts of the
  early 2000s like **Franz Ferdinand** and the **Kaiser Chiefs**.

- **XTC** - I was tempted to lump these guys into the very UK bands above, but
  it didn't feel quite right. They have always been a cult band on both sides of
  the Atlantic. I heard the song "Dear God" on Sirius First Wave (a channel that
  plays classic 80s alternative) in the summer of 2004, after which I sought out
  **Skylarking**. After getting my first real job, I quickly bought the entire
  catalog that was available at that time. Late in the decade, they would
  reissue the difficult to find "Apple Venus" records. I don't know that any
  band exemplifies the kind of intricate pop music that I love. All twelve of
  their studio albums make my list of favorites, and there is no other artist I
  can say anything like that about. I also think they were one of the primary
  influences on the indie-pop movement that was a major part of my early 2000s
  listening habits.

- **Eno/Roxy Music** - When I was a kid, I had the Microsoft Encarta digital
  encyclopedia on CD ROM, and it provided the kind of information that I would
  soon be seeking out on the internet but in a kind of larval form. I remember
  reading the article for **David Bowie** many times. Even before he was my
  favorite artist, the way the article described the artist intrigued me, and
  after I started exploring his music, it gave me ideas on where to go next. In
  addition to hearing about things like "the thin white duke" and the "Glass
  Spider Tour" the article called out several artists that were contemporaries
  of or inspired by Bowie, and in that list was Roxy music and the two Brians,
  Ferry and Eno. In 2004 I would finally hear **Roxy Music** on Sirius First
  Wave. This led me to their classic record **Country Life** which I picked up
  used at a CD & Tape exchange in Cleveland, OH. Interestingly, I have been
  slowly exploring the **Roxy Music** catalog up to the day that I write this. I
  finally purchased a vinyl copy of the last remaining studio LP *Manifesto* in
  September of 2022. Six of their records are now in my top favorites. **Brian
  Eno** was something I sought out purely on the reputation of his early
  records, and my fuzzy memories of that Encarta article. When I started to
  explore his music in 2005, he was in the midst of a major CD reissue program,
  and I bought the whole lot. His four initial pop records, and one of his early
  ambient works make my list.

- **Live Aid/Ultravox/Style Council** - Also in 2004 (this was obviously a year
  when I really started to research the musical past) I purchased a newly
  released DVD box set of the 1985 Live Aid concerts. Those performances had
  always been a bit mysterious to me as they were seldom shown on TV (outside of
  the famous **Queen** set) and I also had the unique situation of having been
  right next to the Philadelphia event while it was going on. On that famous day
  in July 1985 I was with my family at a religious convention in the next
  stadium over. I was only five, but my older brothers definitely wanted to be
  over in JFK stadium for the show instead of sweating their butts off in a suit
  listening to religious propaganda. The DVDs reconnected me with a lot of pop
  music of that day that I had forgotten about (**Paul Young**, **Nik
  Kershaw**), gave me a greater appreciation of acts I had never given proper
  attention (**Madonna**, **Judas Priest**, **Hall and Oates**), and helped me
  discover a few new favorites. I had never heard of **Ultravox** until I
  watched those DVDs for the first time, but immediately after listening, I
  sought out a collection of their Midge Ure era records. I'm still mystified
  why this wonderful and influential new wave act has never gotten any
  mainstream attention in the US. I have to admit that the first time I watched
  the UK portion of the Live Aid show, I thought that **The Style Council** were
  mostly hilarious. I had a hard time taking them too seriously with their
  aggressively 80s style and blued eyed soul music. After I learned to enjoy the
  last record by Paul Weller's first band **The Jam** I started to understand
  what the **Style** were about, and had a new found appreciation. In the last
  years of the decade I even sought out their most famous records. Greg at City
  Lights records always told me he would make me a great deal on the
  comprehensive box set he had kept in stock a decade plus past its cultural
  relevance. I never took him up on his offer, but I did go back and buy it at
  Chronic Town in State College where he was selling some of his remaining stock
  by consignment. I like these guys enough now that I have re-bought their
  entire catalog (minus the crap last record) on vinyl. I had a strange holiday
  tradition where I watched the Live Aid DVDs every Christmas season from 2004
  until 2020, and I pretty much have the concert memorized at this point.

- **Post-Rock** - On a couple occasions I bought records purely because they
  seemed so disproportionately loved on RateYourMusic, and such was the case
  with *Spirit of Eden* by **Talk Talk**. This 2006 purchase led me into the now
  much maligned genre of Post Rock, which at the time was still one of the most
  active and loved genres of the day. This was also the exact time when I
  started to use eMusic to download indie label MP3s. Post Rock was a good
  choice of genre for this service since most of the artists were on indie
  labels and the abundance of long tracks made the pay per download model a
  great value. In addition to buying the popular works in the genre from the
  2000s, I dug back into the 90s originals like **Mogwai**, **Bark Psychosis**,
  and **Slint**. This would lead me to my favorite album of all time:
  *Spiderland*.  

- **Elephant 6** - Another thing I was very interested in around 2006 was this
  Athens GA based collective. They were also a great target for eMusic purchase
  and I was able to get roughly half the important releases that way. The others
  were hunted down as cheap used CD purchases on Amazon. This exploration was
  highly coupled with my interest in the E6 related bands that were still very
  active in the 2000s like **Of Montreal** and **The Apples In Stereo**. I had
  the opportunity to see two E6 related shows in the last year of the decade: a
  performance by **Circulatory System** at SUNY Geneseo and the entire cast of
  principles playing an ensemble holiday show at Soundlab in Buffalo.

- **Red House Painters** - In the early years of the decade I would use the
  AllMusicGuide to do genre studies and download the top tracks using the "MP3
  services of the era". Later, my eMusic subscription gave me a legit way to
  check out the whole albums in the middle years of the decade. That is how it
  was with Mark Kozelek's first project **Red House Painters**. The
  AllMusicGuide pointed me to slowcore, and I found a scattershot collection of
  tunes on the sharing services of the day, but never really did a deep dive on
  the records until around 2006. This would yield three of my favorite albums of
  all time.

- **Frank Zappa/Jazz Fusion** - Weirdly, the last major artist of the past that
  eMusic connected me to was Frank Zappa. I had been hearing his stuff on Sirius
  The Vault for some time, and multiple friends had tried to get me into him
  over the years. Emusic has a single compilation called *Strictly Commercial*
  which gave me a taste of his career. It focused mostly on the jokey pop songs,
  which have never really been my thing, but there were a few things I really
  liked. I especially enjoyed the jazzy stuff like "Peaches En Regalia". This
  would kick off both a study of **Zappa** and jazz fusion artists like:
  **Return to Forever**, **The Mahavishnu Orchestra** and **Weather Report**.
  The XM radio channel "Beyond Jazz" would then connect me with more classic
  jazz fusion and the contemporary fusion artists of the early to mid 2000s.

- **Goth/Dark Punk & New Wave/Wire** - If there was a single theme that ran
  through the decade for me, it was 80s goth and the various goth adjacent forms
  of music. **Joy Division** was a name I kept hearing as I explored the music
  of the past. I think it was when someone accused one of my recent favorites
  **Interpol** from copying them (not true by the way) that I finally looked
  into *Unknown Pleasures*. Around the same time (c. 2002) I was getting very
  into the early **Cure**. Then led by their quieter more ambient project
  **Delerium** I started to listen to industrial electro-goth favorites **Front
  Line Assembly**. There was one band in particular from the 80s goth scene that
  would pull me into the genre. Around 2003 they released one of my favorite 80s
  shows, "Miami Vice" on DVD. There is an episode that features a mostly
  instrumental version of the **Damned** song "In Dulce Decorum" which reminded
  me of how much I loved that song on the *Miami Vice II Soundtrack* Album. I
  downloaded the original version from iTunes, and it was a great point of entry
  to the world of 80s goth. I would gradually build a collection of all the
  **Damned** records and other leading acts in the genre like **Bauhaus**,
  **Christian Death**, and **Echo and the Bunnymen**. My earlier interest in
  **Joy Division** would lead me to the 4AD label a different kind of dark music
  that was more subdued and melodic with bands like **Cocteau Twins**, **This
  Mortal Coil**, and especially the fantastic **Dead Can Dance**. Around 2007, I
  bought the Rhino collection **A Life Less Lived: The Gothic Box** and I became
  fully immersed in the genre. Shortly after, when I started to collect vinyl
  records, goth would be a cornerstone of my collection, and I would buy the
  most famous records by acts like **Sisters of Mercy**, **The Mission**, and
  **The Cult** on reputation alone. Towards the end of the decade I would
  explore the much celebrated, first three records of the band **Wire**. While
  all three are based in dark minimalist punk and new wave, their third, *154*
  might be the finest goth record ever made.

Other Ways That I found Things
------------------------------

There were other ways that I was hearing music in the 2000s and there was music
outside of the range that I feel like I can include in the main list here for
some reason.

- **Party Hip Hop / Rap** - In the year 2000, I moved to State College PA to
  attend Penn State Main Campus. Like most students, I went to parties. The
  party music of the day was the latest hip-hop and rap hits. I especially
  remember hearing "Party Up" by **DMX**, "Big Pimpin'" by **Jay-Z**, and
  "Still D.R.E." by **Dr. Dre**. As someone who was raised in a fairly
  conservative religious movement in white middle America, I was getting exposed
  to a whole new scene through these parties and the music that was featured. It
  led me to tune into MTV for the first time in half a decade where I found out
  about artists like **Ludicris**  ("Rollout"), **Missy Elliot** ("Gossip
  Folks"), and **Outkast** (many songs, but initially **Mrs. Jackson**, and
  **Killer Mike** ("A.D.I.D.A.S."). I did stay in contact with this music,
  mostly at parties in my student days, but generally speaking it hasn't
  followed me into adult life. This music doesn't make much sense to me outside
  of the context I discovered it. I do have a playlist I put on every now and then
  when I want to feel young.

- **Classical Music** - Around the turn of the millennium, my favorite store to
  hang out in was Borders Books, Movies and Music. There was a location very
  close to the Penn State satellite campus I was attending, and I spent a lot of
  time there, particularly in the music section. That location was almost always
  playing what I now know to be baroque music, particularly **J.S. Bach**.
  The staff were happy to direct me to a 2 disc compilation of his work that
  would become the first entry into my classical music collection. Shortly after
  I found a discount box set collection of classical piano favorites at best buy
  on deep discount. The recordings are awful, and I would never listen to this
  box now, but it led me to several pieces that would become lifetime favorites
  particularly "Piano Concerto No. 2" by **Sergei Rachmaninoff**. My friends who
  were in music school at the time tried to talk me out of it because
  **Rachmaninoff** will never be cool, but I didn't care then and I don't care
  now. Around 2001 I heard a MIDI file play in a 3D virtual space in the larval
  metaverse app called "Active Worlds". It was a striking piece of music that I
  discovered to be the slow movement from **Beethoven**'s "Second Symphony".
  That remarkable discovery led to buy a large, expensive box set of all nine of
  his symphonies. At this point I was hooked. On my first trip to London in
  early 2007 I was able to see a live orchestra for the first time. I went to a
  concert in their main series that featured the works of **Janacek** and
  **Brahms**. I would discover two of my favorites at this concert. **Leos
  Janacek** is my favorite composer, and the piece I heard that evening "Taras
  Bulba" is one of my absolute favorites. This would be the first time I heard
  **Brahms** "Violin Concerto", but I liked it so much I would attend a concert
  less than a year later to hear the Colorado symphony perform it as well.
  Around this same time I saw the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey" for the first
  time as an adult. It was a frequent part of the HDNet Movies programming, and
  it was a striking film to see and hear in the new higher resolution. I
  particularly connected with the music of **Gyorgy Ligeti** which would be my
  entry into the very modern sounds of the mid-20th century. I arrived in
  Rochester, NY a big fan of classical music, and ready to consume all that town
  and its conservatory had to offer.

- **Game Music** - The late 90s, and early 2000s was the dawn of the "video
  games as art" movement. One area where innovation and sophistication was being
  felt strongly was the music in the games. The first game where I really
  noticed the music was *Final Fantasy VIII*. In many ways this game is mostly
  remembered for its score by **Nobuo Uematsu** today. I was so struck by it,
  the first thing I ever bought off of ebay back in 2001 was a black market Hong
  Kong produced four CD set of the score. The scores would become more symphonic
  in the PS2 era and the melodramatic, anime style music for *Final Fantasy X*
  (again by **Uematsu**) and *Xenosaga* (by **Yasunori Mitsuda**) were high
  points. In many ways the track "Zanarkand" from *FFX* is the high point for
  the genre of game music in general. By the end of the decade orchestral tours
  would travel internationally to play this material in front of packed houses.
  Simultaneously to this, there was a growing appreciation for the music of the
  16-bit era of the early to mid 90s. While the tools artists had available to
  them was limited there was a lot to like about the core melodies and themes of
  these now ancient scores. Remix sites were created (most noteworthy "OCRemix"
  still exists today) where the music of that era were expanded upon and
  developed in a variety of styles. It was there that the raw scores from
  classics like *F-Zero*, *Megaman X*, and *Castlevania* reached their full
  potential. Of particular note for me is the classic "Filmore" theme ("Filmoa"
  in the Japanese version), and the fact that remixes are still being made of
  this funky track show how much good there is in the 16-bit original. The
  ultimate statement from this time is probably still *Final Fantasy VI* and the
  key tracks from that score, including the opera (?) that somehow was pulled
  off convincingly on SNES hardware are still impressive today. The 90s and
  2000s were the golden age of game music, and I was a big fan in my early 20s.
