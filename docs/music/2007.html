<h1>2007 Albums<a class="headerlink" href="#albums" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I had a sense that when I got to this year, I would have a bit to say in the
introduction text, but didn’t anticipate all the topics that would come to mind.
This was a pivotal year for the music industry, and for me as a listener. These
two things are not coincidental. The MP3 had almost a decade to destroy the model
for pop music that had existed since the late 1960s, and at least initially,
what was left in the ashes was wonderful. By 2007, portable media had made the
MP3 a practical means for music consumption in almost all contexts. In
mainstream music, the single was now again king, but album based rock music was
somehow stronger than ever. Digital distribution had raised awareness of indie
acts that in previous decades would have mostly toiled in obscurity and at best
might have been the favorites of music nerds, and then only retrospectively
be discovered by listeners at large. In this era of music blogs, the obscure could
rapidly become ubiquitous, and attention was getting drawn to increasingly
diverse models of what rock music could be.</p>
<p>The way I was consuming music was changing rapidly, but I clung to the old ways
out of nostalgic stubbornness. Like most people my age I had accumulated a
significant and very not-legit collection of MP3s. Around this time in my life,
I started to assemble a legit recreation and expansion of these illicit files. I
was using an expanded pallette of (legal) means to acquire and curate a rapidly
growing collection. This was the golden age of the subscription/buffet pricing
scheme at eMusic, who for a nominal fee (15-20 dollars a month) could provide a
path to 10 or more indie label releases in digital format. At the time, I had
started to buy my first digital albums from Amazon, but digital was eclipsed by
CDs which were still the main way music was fining its way into my collection. I
would visit City Lights records every Tuesday during my lunch break and leave
with a clutch of the latest releases and likely a bunch of catalog titles I had
special ordered. These were the first crys of “the CD is dead” but I wasn’t
listening. I kept detailed records of every release that made it into my
collection regardless of format and I know that the first album I bought
(<em>Hissing Fauna, Are you the Destroyer?</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong>) was the 900th item
cataloged. A full 372 albums later, the 1272nd record (<em>Weirdo Rippers</em> by <strong>No
Age</strong>) would be logged, surely the most music I have ever acquired in a single
calendar year.</p>
<p>Most of the music I was listening to was still from years gone by, but I was
listening to more new music than I had ever done before. I have an interesting
artifact from this time, the first comprehensive attempt I ever made at a best
of the year list as a full grown adult. It isn’t the final version (unfortunately
lost to time) but an in progress version that I sent to myself via E-mail. I
remember working on this list during my lunch breaks at work during the last
months of the year, and I was sending it home to complete there over the holiday
break. At this point, I owned and could assess 79 different releases! I know
what I considered to be my top 25 records at that time, and 21 of those still
make my modern list. This is a much higher ratio than what would survive from my
2009 favorites (see below), and I think this is a product of my ability to still
listen with a kind of focus that the copious consumption facilitated by digital
streaming would soon destroy.</p>
<p>One of the records that appeared on that original list of favorites that feels
like a case study in everything mentioned above. <em>In Rainbows</em> by <strong>Radiohead</strong>
was the first “pay what you want”, DRM free, digital release by a major,
internationally famous rock band. Admittedly, they were a famous rock band that
didn’t seem very interested in being famous. At the time I have no doubt that I
included it on my list because I thought that it was an important release, and
15 years later, I am convinced that it is one of the most important releases
there has ever been. It is hard to view this album separate from the context in
which it was released, and I can’t of a better way to summarize where pop music
was in 2007 and my relationship with it.</p>

<li><p><em>Pocket Symphony</em> by <strong>Air</strong> - A colder more somber record from these guys
that fits in very well with their other work. It is happy to sit in the
background in a way their other records do not. That icy, sterile album cover
is a perfect summary. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember Greg from City Lights Records
telling me he liked to put this on as he was starting his day in the store.
That sounds just right to me.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>American Doll Posse</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - This was the beginning of a Tori
revival for me, and the start of a revival for the artist. I think playing a
few “alternate roles” for the concept of this record was freeing, and we got
something considerably more interesting than what had come immediately before.
Every album since this one has been a winner. So many different styles on this
record from the mid-tempo singer-songwriter fare of “Bouncing Off of Clouds”
to the rocking “Teenage Hustling” to the classic devastating story song
balladry of “Roosterspur Bridge”. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw Tori for the first time on
this tour, when it came to Pittsburgh. It was a halloween show and the crowd
really took the costume thing very seriously.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>New Magnetic Wonder</em> by <strong>The Apples in Stereo</strong> - I was very into Elephant 6
at the time and was very interested that one of the original bands was still
making new music. This was the first of two records in a a very <strong>ELO</strong> style,
with some weird atonal experiments thrown in. Some stunning pop music, that
makes me sad that Robert Schnieder has largely retired from performing.
[<em>Memory</em>: At the time I didn’t like the shift to <strong>Jeff Lynne</strong> territory,
but wow do I prefer it to the garage psych of their early records now.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Or Give Me Death</em> by <strong>Aqueduct</strong> - Even more than the first record, this
album sounds a bit like what would happen if <strong>Modest Mouse</strong> went full blown
pop. Some really interesting, intricate songs. I really wish more folks had
found these guys so they could have made more music. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw them as
an opening act at Water Street, a few years after this record came out. I
think I was the only one who was familiar with their stuff. Great show.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Neon Bible</em> by <strong>Arcade Fire</strong> - Until the awful <strong>Everything Now</strong> was
released, this was my least favorite of their albums. Unlike that mess, I
still really like this one. It was never going to live up to the incredible
debut, but there is a lot here to like. I especially enjoy the church organ
and pomp of “Intervention” and “My Body is a Cage”. [<em>Memory</em>: I waited a
really long time to buy this one on vinyl. I’m not sure why, as this is a
brilliant record that sounds great on the analog format.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mirrored</em> by <strong>Battles</strong> - A really cool, percussion forward post-rock album.
Not quite math rock, but still lots of interesting rhythms. They would never
make something this interesting again. [<em>Memory</em>: This kind of defines the
line for an album I like, but don’t need to own on vinyl. I’ve considered it
many times, but really digital is good enough for this. Why, I’m not exactly
sure.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Flying Club Cup</em> by <strong>Beirut</strong> - One of those bands, where I like much of
their music, but love only a few things. This is by far my favorite of their
records. It is a much stronger statement with solid songwriting throughout. “A
Sunday Smile” has those nostalgic, highly melodic, feel good vibes that is
their best sound. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw Owen Pallet join them on some of these
tunes at Pitchfork 2009, and it is the moment you see in the banner above.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>..are the Dark Horse</em> by <strong>The Besnard Lakes</strong> - A really nice low-fi, psych
record with some cool little <strong>Beach Boys</strong> elements. They would milk this
formula to good effect for a few more records, but this will always be my
favorite. “For Agent 13” is my favorite use of shortwave numbers stations in a
song. [<em>Memory</em>: When I started buying vinyl records, this was one of the
first recent releases I picked up. It was also one of the first records that
made me realize the shortcomings of vinyl production, when it arrived covered
in scuffs.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Armchair Apocrypha</em> by <strong>Andrew Bird</strong> - I know many people consider this
the inferior follow-up, but I prefer it to anything else in his catalog. I
think it focusses more on straight ahead indie rock in a way that serves the
purpose well. The slick use of the looper and strings is still there, but the
songs are sharper and catchier. That said, this isn’t something I am
revisiting often today. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw him on this tour at the State Theater
in State College, PA. I really enjoyed the show. Only a few years later I saw
him in Rochester and it was awful. Had the performance changed, or had I?]</p></li>
<li><p><em>23</em> by <strong>Blonde Redhead</strong> - A really nice midpoint between dream-pop and
straight ahead indie rock. I didn’t realize it at the time since I was
discovering them well into their career, but this is the sound of an “old
indie” band updating their sound to fit right in with the new scene of the
moment. [<em>Memory</em>: I have to admit, I bought this as much for the striking
cover as for the solid reviews. Surely one of the last times I picked a record
that way?]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Andorra</em> by <strong>Caribou</strong> - It doesn’t seem like it today, because this kind of
thing is everywhere now, but this kind of psychedelic, electronic thing was
very innovative at the time. He would have two great records after this, but
this was the peak. A great mix of pop and experimentation. [<em>Memory</em>: I’m a
bit ashamed to admit that back in these days I was getting almost anything
Pitchfork gave BNM to that sounded half wise interesting. The indie stuff was
all on Emusic, and an album was about 2-3 bucks there. It was worth it to even
hate listen the thing. This one really worked out.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Friend Opportunity</em> by <strong>Deerhoof</strong> - My first record of theirs, and still my
favorite. The perfect mix of the punk aggression and the pop cuteness. The
definitive early 2000s indie band at their peak. Such complex, unusual music
that manages to be unbelievably re-listenable. I’ll never get sick of this
record. [<em>Memory</em>: This was an amazing time for musical discovery. The tools
at my disposal to hear new things and rise of indie created a unique situation
I will never see again. Every couple weeks I was discovering a new favorite
band like this that already had a half a dozen or so great albums.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Copia</em> by <strong>Eluvium</strong> - It is hard to make ambient music that really stands
out. This is gorgeous, and wholely unique. There isn’t anything else out there
with this same kind of warm but vacant vibe. The title of the track “Indoor
Swimming at the Space Station” really captures the scene well. [<em>Memory</em>: I
was really into the ambient works by Eno at the time and when I saw a modern
ambient record getting good press, I had to check it out.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Widow City</em> by <strong>The Fiery Furnaces</strong> - A number of indie pop acts had been
becoming increasingly weird over the last decade or so, and these guys started
out the weirdest of them all. This is a lot to digest. The funky keyboards,
the Zeppelin-esque hard rock guitar, Emily Freidberger’s off-kilter delivery
of her brothers weird poetry, all framed by mostly jaunty piano based pop
songs. Peak weird suited these guys best of all. [<em>Memory</em>: At the time, they
had been so productive it was easy to assume this would go on indefinitely.
Little did we know we would get only one more (fairly conservative) effort,
and the sibling band would go on permanent hiatus.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Good, The Bad, and the Queen</em> by <strong>The Good, The Bad, and the Queen</strong> -
The work of a unusual supergroup that ends up sounding more like the somber,
non-fiction continuation of its most famous member’s former band (Blur). A
brilliant meditation on the role of England in the 21st century. For almost 10
years, this was the most valuable record in my collection, and it deserved to
be so. It is a cult classic of the highest order, and one of my very
favorites. [<em>Memory</em>: In 2007 I took two trips to the UK for business. Both
times I was able to get up to London to do some tourist stuff. This album
became the soundtrack to the first trip and I streamed it repeatedly on my
trusty old iPod nano. On the second trip I saw a special performance of the
record in the moat of the Tower of London. What a memory I will cherish
forever!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>White Chalk</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - [<strong>2007 FAVORITE</strong>] What a left turn for
Polly Jean. The guitar is almost gone. The muscular vocals are no more,
replaced with her “church voice”. The aesthetic of this album is remarkable.
Barely proficient enough to make a piano based record, she finds incredible
songs in the simple arrangements. The creepy victorian attire she matched to
this music really completed the scene. Already an all-time great, this is
where it went to the next level. [<em>Memory</em>: I was already going to City Lights
every Tuesday to pick up the latest releases, but I particularly remember
rushing out as soon as the store opened that September to pick this one up.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cross</em> by <strong>Justice</strong> - While <strong>Daft Punk</strong> generally get all the attention
these guys made the foremost masterpiece of French Electronic music right
here. Everything is perfect, from the bombast of “Genesis”, through the pure
joy of “D.A.N.C.E.” to the wonderful crassness of <strong>Uffie’s</strong> rap on “The
Party”. This might be the best electronic dance music ever made. [<em>Memory</em>: I
used to like to play this during my runs at the time. I remember playing it
over the stereo system in the work gym one time and being really embarrassed
when <strong>Uffie</strong> started in on her rap, lol.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sound of Silver</em> by <strong>LCD Soundsystem</strong> - It can be hard to remember that
before EDM ruined things, electronic music was was of the most interesting and
fertile grounds for new musical ideas. They aren’t really doing anything new
here, but the combination of Krautrock grooves, disco beats, and New Wave
vocals was the perfect pallette for some great songs. “Someone Great” is a top
10 all-time track. [<em>Memory</em>: I was already sold on these guys from their
early singles and was right on this album when it was released. I remember
Greg at City lights being very lukewarm. I remember telling one of the trendy
interns at work about it, and how meh they were. It eventually became regarded
as an all time classic. I felt very ahead of the curve.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Night Falls over Kortedala</em> by <strong>Jens Lekman</strong> - This is a weird case. A
classic album, that the artist decided to replace with a completely new
version. I think I still like the original more, since it has a wonderful
quaintness that isn’t quite as strong on the new version. It is a guy trying
to make the symphonic <strong>Scott Walker</strong> records in his bedroom. The kind of
pure pop singing that only Scandinavians are allowed to do these days.
[<em>Memory</em>: This was the first year that I reviewed the top albums lists by the
major sites. This one was very high on the Pitchfork list and I gave it a
shot.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Memory Almost Full</em> by <strong>Paul McCarney</strong> - Paul clearly was becoming aware of
the peaking indie rock scene, and it shows. One of his strongest later year
efforts, especially the power pop of “Only Mamma Knows” and the eccentric
vocoder and harpsichord experimental pop of “Feet in the Clouds”. [<em>Memory</em>:
I remember listening to this on my Sansa as I waited for my plane from
Heathrow to Dublin, drinking a Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout right at the gate.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Obligatory Villagers</em> by <strong>Nellie McKay</strong> - It is weird that her best album
is almost impossible to hear these days, and I’m glad to have the physical CD
(I assume there are rights issues). The perfect combination of comical
commentary and top notch songwriting. This time with an amazing collection of
jazz musicians to give everything a dramatic cabaret feel. [<em>Memory</em>: Soon
after this album, she did a video with NPR music that documented her
songwriting process, which was quite remarkable.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Friend and Foe</em> by <strong>Menomena</strong> - The first shot fired in the “floor tom
band” scene. This highly percussive brand of melodic indie rock was super
novel at time, but would be cliche less than a year later. Still a solid
record, but it is hard to hear it the same way after all the soundalikes. The
sax does add a little something extra that makes this hold up a bit better
than the rest. [<em>Memory</em>: These guys hold the unique distinction of being a
band I have seen live, but do not really remember having seen. I saw them in
Philly in 2010, and remember it as being a good show, but nothing else really.
At least I have the shirt to prove I was there.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Challengers</em> by <strong>The New Pornographers</strong> - An outstanding record that both
shows what a great pop band they are together, but the strengths that the
three primary songwriters have as individuals. Also some great vocals from new
member Kathryn Calder, especially “Adventures in Solitude”. “My Rights Versus
Yours” is one of the greatest opening tracks ever. The way it slowly builds to
introduce the sounds of the record is first rate album sequencing. [<em>Memory</em>:
At first I wasn’t so sure about the mellower mood of this record, but I now
appreciate this as one of their finest efforts.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Boxer</em> by <strong>The National</strong> - The pivot album between the more punk influenced
sounds of the first few records, and the mid-tempo alt-rock that would come.
First rate musicianship throughout, and Matt Berninger’s voice is as rich and
textured as it would ever be. “Mistaken for Strangers” is the finest product
of their early phase. [<em>Memory</em>: I was so resistant to these guys, and refused
to engage with this record when it was new. All of a sudden when I hit my 30s,
I liked few bands more.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hissing Fauna, You Are the Destroyer</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong> - The album where
his bedroom psych pop went dance. It wasn’t as big of a tweak as it sounded at
the time, but it was apparently the move that made the world appreciate the
talent that had always been there. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember playing this CD in my
office after a visit to City Lights Records on new music Tuesday. The uptempo
dance groove was a bit shocking to me as a long time fan, but I was on board
for the new sounds from the start. I was shocked that the general public was
too. It was a unique time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Stage Names</em> by <strong>Okkervil River</strong> - This was a straightforward indie
rock pallette cleanser in one of the most experimental eras. The definition of
NPR music, it is quaint but not bland, and often quite pretty. “Savannah
Smiles” is a particular highlight. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw these guys in Rochester on
the next album cycle. It was clear from the setlist that they recognized this
as their best work.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em> by <strong>Spoon</strong> - Indie rock was peaking and new buzz bands were
emerging every week. Some of the American indie acts that had been at it since
the late 90s were raising to prominence in a whole new way. This was the
record where Austin’s biggest secret used their heightened influence to make a
very big, Motown tinged record. It was their highest point. [<em>Memory</em>: There
are two times in my life I had to pull over my car because I heard a new song
that was too good for me to concentrate. “You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb” was one of
them.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Marry Me</em> by <strong>St. Vincent</strong> - Far smaller, but no less complex, the contrast
is stunning with where the artist is now. I miss the sound of this record (and
the one that came later). Somehow she has gotten way noisier and flashier, yet
way more boring. These ornate, but subtle home recordings are some of the
finest songs in indie-pop history. I try to not be one of those people who
complain about artists selling out for mainstream fame, but I can’t see
anything else here. [<em>Memory</em>: I downloaded this record from eMusic based
purely on their review. I got so much great music off of that site.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In Our Bedroom After the War</em> by <strong>Stars</strong> - I know the record before this is
supposed to be the classic (and it is a perfectly fine indie pop record) but
this will always be my favorite. Such sweet little songs with strong
melodies and warm vocals. Every now and then they show glimpses of something
more than pop, like the jazz influenced “My Favorite Book”. [<em>Memory</em>: One of
those records I listened to on repeat on my Sansa MP3 player during lunchtime
walks at work around the East College Ave area.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Random Spirit Lover</em> by <strong>Sunset Rubdown</strong> - A wonderfully strange record.
Low budget indie-prog made by an artist who had won fame making straight ahead
indie rock with his other band <strong>Wolf Parade</strong>. I assume that connection was
the only reason the general music press even cared about this, but I’m glad it
was brought to my attention. You get the impression that the musicians being
stretched way beyond their ability, but what they produced ended up amazing
anyway. “Stallion” is so over the top and outrageously good. [<em>Memory</em>: When I
started buying Vinyl LPs, this was one of the first things I sought out. This
is meant for physical media.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>All Hour Cymbals</em> by <strong>Yeasayer</strong> - <strong>Menomena</strong> were first, but this was the
record that broke the sound. One of those discs that would spawn a million
imitators, this kind of percussive, dance-able indie-pop would be pervasive
over the next half decade. While this band would soon move on to other
things, they leave behind one of the finest and most interesting entries in
the sub-genre. [<em>Memory</em>: I distinctly remember listening to this for the
first time waiting for an early AM flight at the State College, PA airport.]</p></li>
