<h1>2010s<a class="headerlink" href="#s" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2010s.jpg"><img alt="Pitchfork Music Festival 2011" src="../_images/2010s.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>This was an interesting decade for music and for my relationship with music.
When it began, we were at the point I like to call “peak indie” where a
collection of small labels were releasing the most culturally relevant albums,
and the big labels were trying to pretend they were the small labels in order to
compete. I was writing for a local music blog, and attending multiple large music
festivals per year. These were mostly the (now rare) club festivals that were
spread out among multiple small venues over several days. These were the kind of
festivals that demanded research and study to attend properly. I loved the
process of reading about all the bands, getting ahold of a sample of music, and
laying out my plan to rove about the clubs to catch my favorites. The tee-shirts
and vinyl records bought from merch stands at these shows are now staples of my
wardrobe and album collection today.</p>
<p>When the decade closed, mainstream pop from the major labels had returned as the
dominant force in the music scene. This kind of mainstream music had never
really went away, it was more
that independent music receded to the shadows again. I have nothing against
mainstream pop, as my lists for earlier decades show. My objections mostly have
to do with the impacts of how modern pop music is made. Today, your average pop
single is written and produced by a committee of dozens. When that many folks
contribute to the creative process it has the effect of sanding every edge off
of the track by the time
it reaches the finish line. Any remaining distinguishing characteristics are so
intentionally created, that it can’t help but feel contrived. I haven’t been to a
music festival since 2013. That last one was the inaugural “Crossing Brooklyn
Ferry”, a combination of the most high brow indie combined with artists that
typically get labeled as contemporary classical. The rest of the decade, 75% of
the live music I saw was the local symphony orchestra, This was where “I got
old”, but where exactly did it happen?</p>

<h2>2015<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I turned 35 in 2015, which sounded very old at the time. My relationship with
music was also making me feel old. I saw three bands this year: The Psychedelic
Furs, The Church, and The Chameleons. It was the year of 80s nostalgia I guess.
I was very much treading musical water, keeping in touch with the artists that
hadn’t let me down in the past. That ended up working out really well in 2015,
as several of my favorites released their best work.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2015.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 2015" src="../_images/2015.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="80" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/55DcWRgBQciL97k3bsftmi?theme=0" width="100%"></iframe><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Depression Cherry</em> by <strong>Beach House</strong> - This was when the world caught up with
what I already knew, these guys were one of the best bands currently working.
It is a little strange that dream pop made by two people with fairly minimal
instrumentation and fairly consistent production techniques has had such
staying power. This is great record, and “Beyond Love” is my favorite song of
theirs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Thank Your Lucky Stars</em> by <strong>Beach House</strong> - Now, releasing two records after
one another was some serious flexing. In my opinion, this one is even a little
bit better. It certainly is a bit brighter in a way that I like.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance</em> by <strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong> - Very solid an
enjoyable, but the kind of record that made me wonder how much more they could
milk the sound they had been working for the last decade plus. Sarah Marin’s
vocal contributions continue to carry the band a bit at this point.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Honeymoon</em> by <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong> - A very mellow left turn for Lana, this
wasn’t perfect by any means, but it was an important step in a different
direction that she still is on.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Meliora</em> by <strong>Ghost</strong> - This is the record where the formula came together in
a big way. It is amazing how something so satirical can be such seriously
great music. “He Is” is such a beautiful and stunningly produced mockery of
christian rock.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Have You In My Wilderness</em> by <strong>Julia Holter</strong> - I have had a strange
relationship with this record. I was exposed to the song “silhouette” by
Spotify radio soon after it came out and loved it. I listened to only that
song for years and never sought out the record. When I finally heard the whole
album and loved it, I never checked out any of her other releases. I don’t
know why I am approaching this artist so cautiously. This is the kind of
conservatory trained musician making complicated but highly melodic music
thing that I love.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bones</em> by <strong>Son Lux</strong> - NPR’s favorite son recruits some permanent members
and becomes a real band. It was the best thing to ever happen to this project.
This is nerd rock at its finest. I saw them at the Warhol museum on the tour
after this record, and that was the right kind of place to see this
adventurous art rock. A very strong concept record, this one to listen to from
beginning to end. Still my favorite of theirs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em> by <strong>Sufjan Stevens</strong> - I think there is a prevailing
opinion that this is Sufjan’s finest work. I’m glad he made this record so
that the general public can understand the brilliance of this man, but I’m
far happier that he immediately returned to making the weird stuff I like way
more. Still a fine folk record with that Sufjan magic, but a bit too
conservative to stand with his best work.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Multi-Love</em> by <strong>Unknown Mortal Orchestra</strong> - They finally got it all to work
together here. The delightfully funky electronic sound they occasionally got
to work on their first two releases comes into focus here. Such a great
sounding production as well, even though I’m pretty sure this is an analog
home recording made in that little studio on the cover.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hand Cannot Erase</em> by <strong>Steven Wilson</strong> - A mellow prog rock concept record
about an isolated person dying alone. Obviously intended to be sad and
haunting, but also exceptionally beautiful. Feels like a massive upgrade to
the Stupid Dream/Lightbulb Sun era <strong>Porcupine Tree</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Vespers for a New Dark Age</em> by <strong>Victoire</strong> and <strong>Missy Mazzoli</strong>. The first
Victoire record was a classically trained composer creating a rock band to
make a very unusual kind of prog rock. This album is the composer using that
band to play a contemporary classical work. In a way this albums felt like the
end of “indie classical” and while I liked to scoff at the idea of a genre, it
was a real and compelling thing. The remix of “A Thousand Tongues” by the very
much not a classical composer <strong>Lorna Dune</strong> feels like the last glorious
moments of the spirit of classical music nerds forming rock bands.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Epic</em> by <strong>Kamasi Washington</strong> - This is the most recent of my favorite
albums that I do not own on vinyl, but easily could if I wanted to. I think it
says a lot. I really like this triple album of modern jazz fusion, but I like
his next record even more. There is nothing here that makes me need to own
another quite epic release on vinyl, but I spin this one on Spotify often. The
texture of this music is exceptional.</p></li>

<h2>2016<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A significant portion of the music from this year was actually discovered during
my attempt to reconnect with pop music in the following year. The other albums
are all from established artists that I had be following for years. I’ll
remember this year mostly for the passing of three of my favorite artists:
George Michael, Prince, and David Bowie.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2016.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 2016" src="../_images/2016.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="80" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0UKeYHGoGOzLvhyuxxXSCc?theme=0" width="100%"></iframe><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Blackstar</em> by <strong>David Bowie</strong> - It is difficult to think about this record
outside of the context in which it arrived. My pre-ordered copy showed up in the
mail two days after Bowie, my favorite musician had died. It was so mysterious
and exciting, but it was also the end of the story. Pop’s ultimate performer had
one last grand statement on the world stage, the big exit. Experimenting with
new sounds until the very end, it is hard to imagine there will ever again be a
musician who is both this massively popular and  yet committed to pushing
the boundaries of pop music.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Foreverland</em>  by <strong>Divine Comedy</strong> - In my opinion, this is the weakest of
the Divine Comedy records released to date, but it is still among my
favorites. Neil Hannon feels very content here, and I think it is reducing
some of the tension and contemplation that have made his previous work great.
I actually own two vinyl copies of this, since my first one is signed by the
artist, but I had to buy the reissue because Hannon’s liner notes are that
good.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Hope Six Demolition Project</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - In 2016 we finally got
the PJ Harvey saxophone record we had been waiting for. This record somehow
feels like the capstone on what Polly has been up to for the last decade with
her younger voice and harder sound rejoining her contemplative, social justice
minded songwriting. I love the crazy aesthetic for this tour with Polly Jean
dressed up in feathers playing in a chorus of saxophones.</p></li>
<li><p><em>King</em> by <strong>We are KING</strong> - This was the record that brought my attention back
to modern pop music. I have an annual tradition of watching the Grammy awards
ceremony. Most years I hate nearly everything, but I like to stay in touch
with what is going on in pop. I heard a snippet of “Red Eye” from this record
during the presentation of the award for the “Urban Contemporary Album of the
Year”. This would put me on a path of exploration in what we now call
“Alternative R&amp;B” that continues to today.</p></li>
<li><p><em>X-Communicate</em> by <strong>Kristin Kontrol</strong> - Kristin Gundred is a masterful mimic
of the music of the past. Starting with her band <strong>Dum Dum Girls</strong> she
excelled of mining the past without sounding totally derivative. Her first
solo record manages to borrow liberally from late 80s Kate Bush, and 2010s
synth pop, while adding just enough to stand up totally on its own. I really
hope there will be another record from this project.</p></li>
<li><p><em>I Had a Dream That You Were Mine</em> by <strong>Hamilton Leithouser</strong> and <strong>Rostam</strong> -
This record ended up sounding like the combination of <strong>The Walkmen</strong> and
<strong>Vampire Weekend</strong> that it seemed like it would be on paper. This is aging
hipster music done right.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mass Gothic</em> by <strong>Mass Gothic</strong> - In what was a big theme to my middle 2010s,
this album is some of my favorite artists of the previous decade moving on to
their next project. In this case, the husband/wife duo from <strong>Hooray for
Earth</strong> and <strong>Zambri</strong> teaming up to make some delightfully poppy noise rock.
“Every Night You’ve Got to Save Me” is a stunning single that shows off what
these underrated musicians can do.</p></li>
<li><p><em>blond</em> by <strong>Frank Ocean</strong> - A stunning concept record by one of the best
artists working today. My vinyl copy of this record is an amazingly made
bootleg, because the real thing is worth over 400 bucks these days. Ocean
seems intent on only being so popular, almost choosing artistic relevance
over fame. It is hard to argue with the results. “Nights” might be the best
song of the last 10 years.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tigarello</em> by <strong>Phonte</strong> and <strong>Eric Robertson</strong> - Nothing says where my head
is at these days than this album of rap songs about the bliss of  monogamy
and settling down. Hip hop for rapidly approaching middle age.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Jessica Rabbit</em> by <strong>Sleigh Bells</strong> - These guys are making some great tunes
completely under the radar. I wish the hipsters that were buzzing about this
band at the start of the decade were still paying attention. This is some
surprisingly complex, rocking stuff.</p></li>

<h2>2017<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2017 I made a specific effort to pay more attention to modern music.
Admittedly, I wasn’t trying very hard and my efforts were mostly about
using the discovery features of Spotify. This did yield some fruit (particularly
in the R&amp;B renaissance that was going on) but this year is still mostly
comprised of artists from the early century indie boom that I had been following for years.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2017.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 2017" src="../_images/2017.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0aoSZPgfa910GZKWAPnrAa?theme=0" width="100%"></iframe><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Unplugged</em> by <strong>A-ha</strong> - This is certainly the outlier here, a very 90s kind
of performance from a very 80s band. I had heard for years about how A-ha were
way more popular in Europe and how they were much better than the one hit
wonder they were here. The Spotify algorithm decided I needed to her this, and
I’m glad it did. The understated arrangements really show off how great their
songwriting is. I’m a huge fan now.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Native Invader</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - After her previous record I had assumed
that Tori was going to make much smaller and more subtle music in her later
career. This record certainly proved me wrong on that. A return to her late
90s glory years, this album is a very big sounding, and at times straight up
rocking. This isn’t <em>Choirgirl</em>, but it isn’t too far from the best of
<em>Venus</em>. <em>Geraldines</em> scared me a little bit because Tori was starting to
sound a bit older. This record makes it clear there are many exciting records
yet to come.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</em> by <strong>Ariel Pink</strong> - Yes it breaks my heart that
he has been outed as a terrible person, and I can’t imagine I’ll be keeping up
with his career going forward. That said, these records are stunning works of
outsider brilliance. If I’m going to keep records by people like Michael
Jackson on this list, there is room for the work other deeply flawed artists.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Lust for Life</em> by <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong> - It is her weakest record thus far, but
still among my favorites. The whole thing is a little to mid tempo monotonous,
but there are still some stunners here, including the title track. The
outstanding production values of the record really puts this one over the top.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dirty Projectors</em> by <strong>Dirty Projectors</strong> - While this project existed before
and will continue after the musical (and romantic) partnership of Dave
Longstreth and Amber Coffman, I doubt I will ever enjoy the records made by
those other incarnations nearly as much. The exception is this Longstreth solo
effort that serves as a document of the dissolution of that central
partnership, and a compelling bookend to an amazing run of records.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Jardín</em> by <strong>Gabriel Garzón-Montano</strong> - 2017 was the year I discovered what
is now called “Alternative R&amp;B”. An ambiguous genre, to me it feels like a
return to what Stevie Wonder was attempting to to in the mid-70s. This record
especially feels like the kind of thing Stevie would have come up with if he
had been born in the 90s.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Painted Ruins</em> by <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong> - Some bands are constantly changing and
trying new sounds, others like Grizzy Bear, started with a fully developed
sound and have been gradually perfecting it. I’m curious how many more albums
of this same general formula I will tolerate. “Losing All Sense” is getting
pretty close to the ultimate implementation of this kind of music.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Choir of the Mind</em> by <strong>Emily Haines</strong> - <em>Metric</em> is a fine band, but Haines
solo work is on a completely different level. We seem to only get one classic
album a decade from her, but maybe that is why the level of songcraft is so
high. A gorgeous set of songs mostly about the artist and her piano with just
enough atmospheric electronics and vocal overdubbing to create a pleasant
warmth.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Melodrama</em> by <strong>Lorde</strong> - This album is amazing, but it fills me with
anxiety. I greatly fear the machinations of mainstream pop music will get
their hooks into Lorde and turn her into a Billie Eilish style commercial
interest instead of her far more interesting authentic self. This album put
her much more on the <strong>Kate Bush</strong> path of a prodigy bucking prevailing trends
and pushing the boundaries of modern pop. Will this be allowed to continue?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sleep Well Beast</em> by <strong>The National</strong> - I’m an aging indie bro, so of
course I love these guys. There is just enough here to connect me to the band
I have loved over the last 10 years. Somehow though, it is just gut enough in
a way that makes it feel like my jumping off point.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Kid Kruschev</em> by <strong>Sleigh Bells</strong> - In the 2010s there were many buzz
bands that got way more attention and credit than they probably deserved early
in their careers. Some of them have developed into stunning artists that
probably are now not getting nearly enough credit. Chief among them is Sleigh
Bells, who have turned their semi-obnoxious combination of electronics, guitar
riffs, and belting into art rock gold. “Rainmaker” might be the best ever
invocation of the “Ashely’s Roachclip” break, and that is saying something.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Planetarium</em> by <strong>Sufjan Stevens</strong>, <strong>Nico Muhly</strong>, <strong>Bryce Dessner</strong>, and
<strong>James McAlister</strong> - I saw a workshop performance of this at the 2012 Music
Now festival. I didn’t care for it very much then, and the finished product
feels way different. I’m fairly certain that Sufjan pretty much wrapped this
one up on his own because in the end we got something very much in line with
<em>the BQE</em> and <em>Age of Adz</em>. I’m really pleased that the weirdest form of
electo-Sufjan got one last time to shine.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fin</em> by <strong>Syd</strong> - A great piece of minimalist “alternative R&amp;B”. I want
dozens more albums in this genre.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Drunk</em> by <strong>Thundercat</strong> - Is this the new jazz fusion? I hope so. Jazz and
fusion have become genres for boring white people rehashing the past. This
combination of bass virtuosity and funky sounds is super compelling. Bonus
points for the effective use of Kenny Loggins.</p></li>
<li><p><em>To the Bone</em> by <strong>Steven Wilson</strong> - I’m fascinated how Wilson is almost
repeating the same career trajectory of his band <strong>Porcupine Tree</strong> again as a
solo artist. In both cases he started off as a prog rock revivalist. The
second phase, which for his solo career commences with this record, is a
lighter alt rock sound. Perhaps the return to progressive metal concept albums
is just around the corner? Wilson has mixed in some killer pop songs over the
years, but “Permanating” is the finest yet.</p></li>

<h2>2018<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I think the best summary of this year is that all of these albums, except for
two were by artists that were among my favorites going into the year. Those two
new artists were both discovered on NPRs All Things Considered. I may have been
a bit out of touch with popular music.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2018.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 2018" src="../_images/2018.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4pSrzHRA9VaFcj48PgrE1R?theme=0" width="100%"></iframe><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino</em> by <strong>Arctic Monkeys</strong> - Of all the bands to
come out of the early 2000s post punk revival, these guys have stayed the most
interesting for me. All the genre hopping on this one put a lot of people off,
but it is why I still care about them.</p></li>
<li><p><em>7</em> by <strong>Beach House</strong> - The name is a reference to this being the seventh
record, all of which are among my favorites of all time. It feels a little
weird to me that my favorite modern band is a two person dream pop act. There
are a lot of familiar sounds on those seven records, but it never gets old.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Prequelle</em> by <strong>Ghost</strong> - After the last record, I was really hoping for more
power ballads along the lines of “He Is” and we got them, and it was great.
“Life Eternal” does such an amazing job straddling the line of comic theatrics
and beautiful sincerity. Some killer rocking tunes too (e.g. “Rats”).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Merrie Land</em> by <strong>The Good, the Bad, and the Queen</strong> - Somehow I missed the
release of this album, and didn’t find out about it until two years later.
Their self titled record was one of my favorites from the last decade, and
I thought it was a one off project. Like the first one, this album is a big time grower
that takes a bit to get into. Given the passing of Tony Allen I assume this is
the last one, but it already feels like a bonus that we have this.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Book of Travelers</em> by <strong>Gabriel Kahane</strong> - I saw Kahane perform this album
twice, the first of those as a multimedia performance at BAM. The story of his
cross country train trip looses something without the little stories he told
between songs, but it is still a beautiful set of melancholy little folk
tunes that reminds me of those great performances.</p></li>
<li><p><em>I’ve Tortured You Long Enough</em> by <strong>Mass Gothic</strong> - Now sounding like a
direct merger of their former bands <strong>Hooray for Earth</strong> and <strong>Zambri</strong> I am
very much sold on this project. I’m really pleased that Jessica Zambri is now
singing most of the songs as it suits the style better somehow.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Little Dark Age</em> by <strong>MGMT</strong> - After their highly disappointing, self titled
third album, I had given up on these guys. I can usually sense when a band has
lost the sound that made me enjoy them in the first place. When they came back
with this strong release out of nowhere it was the surprise of the decade for
me. They did it by finding their way back to their old sound. Sometimes
regression is a good thing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dirty Computer</em> by <strong>Janelle Monae</strong> - This album has been influenced by the
sounds of highly manufactured, modern pop music. At first it was shocking and
disappointing from an artist who seems to transcend that kind of thing.
Eventually I was able to find the things that make Monae one of my favorites,
and I can appreciate this for what it is: a way above average implementation
of 21st century pop idioms.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Soil</em> by <strong>serpentwithfeet</strong> - NPR discovery 1 of 2. I love when the sounds of
church music are adapted to a more honorable purpose. A former choirboy turned
Satanist makes a gorgeous record of queer love songs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Brighter Wounds</em> by <strong>Son Lux</strong> - A fitting place between two new NPR
discoveries, for an artist who owes their career to NPR. That early public
radio fame has led to one of the strangest bands to have a fairly large
following. Their second record as a legit three piece band, they are really
testing the limits of their audience with this challenging record. “Forty
Screams” is such a complex, stunning opener for an album that never quite
matches that opening intensity.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Heaven and Earth</em> by <strong>Kamasi Washington</strong> - I love jazz fusion (as is clearly
evident by my 1970s favorites). There isn’t much good fusion being made today,
but Washington gave us three whole disks worth here. His band is killer and I
particularly enjoy the vocal contributions of Patrice Quinn (and I normally
hate vocal jazz). NPR discovery 2 of 2.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dirt</em> by <strong>Yamantaka//Sonic Titan</strong> - I bought my vinyl copy of this record
from Alaska B, the leader and only consistent member of this art metal band.
She was surrounded with an almost all new assortment of Montreal musicians
who had taken the band in a new, much heavier direction.
The show was at BugJar, the tiny indie club down the street from my house. It
was incredible to see such loud music in such a small space, what a night.</p></li>

<h2>2019<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This year holds the distinction of me having the fewest favorite albums from
the years I lived through first hand. There is no question I was
almost completely disengaged from looking for new music. I spent a lot of time
listening to the local classical music station, and some time looking backward
thinking about the project I am working on here.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2019.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 2019" src="../_images/2019.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3J3ZDe6pnhcNWbCEHKsY1m?theme=0" width="100%"></iframe><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Norman Fucking Rockwell</em> by <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong> - This was the only album that I
discovered and fully engaged with during the year of 2019. I like all of
Lana’s albums, but this one is stunning. The songwriting has gone to a new
level, and she has really separated herself from her peers working in the the
crowded female singer songwriter (with a large support team) space of our
current era. “Venice Bitch” and “Hope is a Dangerous Thing for A Woman Like Me
to Have, but I Have it” are her two finest songs so far.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Office Politics</em> by <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> - No act played a bigger part in my
late 2010s listening that Neil Hannon and company. I had largely stayed away
from the newer records, as I was for some reason convinced that their best work
was back in the 90s. I especially avoided this record due to that horrendous
cover making it look like some sort of comedy record. Hannon has always gone
right up to the line of being a “joke band” but has managed to stay in the
region of witty, ornate chamber pop. This record was a pretty big departure
musically, with a broad range of styles, and has the most humor we have seen
from him in over 20 years. I was wrong to be suspicious, this is an exciting
reinvention and an indication of a bright future.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Forever</em> by <strong>Metronomy</strong> - When I heard this back in 2019 I immediately
loved the song “Sex Emoji” but didn’t really get the rest.  This is one of
Metronomy’s more difficult albums, and it took some time to warm up to the
more intricate, atmospheric electronic parts.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Motion</em> by <strong>Rone</strong> - Somewhere between electronic music and contemporary
classical, I love this kind of thing. I have my Spotify weekly recommendations
to thank for this one. Good job Spotify! This is technically a long single,
not an album. This is how little music I’ve heard from 2019, that I need to
count this.</p></li>
