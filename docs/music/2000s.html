<h2>2005<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have developed a pattern for how I compile the sections for each year. Around
the time that I start writing for the year I am working on immediately prior
(which is actually the next year, since I am doing this in reverse) I look at my
list for the next year to be addressed (which is actually the year before) and
decide if any changes are required. I also decide if there are any records I
want to seek out on vinyl that I do not currently have, so that they can appear
in the picture. I knew going in that this was the year that I had the lowest
ratio of favorites owned on vinyl, with only just over a third in my collection
as LPs. Then started a surprisingly difficult sub-project to get my vinyl ratio
to 50% for 2005. It took so long that I am starting on the writing well before I
will be able to get a picture, but I did locate some really nice additions to
get myself to my target. Why is the vinyl ratio so low this year? I think the
number one factor is that this is the end of the “vinyl dark ages” when the
format was in full decline, but not enough time has passed for 20 year reissues
and other forces to get these records back in print. I also think that it is
just far enough away from when I started buying records (2008) that these
releases were not fresh in mind, and therefore not on my list to repurchase on
the big discs. Finally, there are a number of legitimately obscure indie records
here that are likely to never see a vinyl reissue.</p>
<p>This is where the acceleration in my music purchasing would begin. In early 2005
I would get my first real job, and one of the places those new found funds would
go are full price CDs from Mikes Movies &amp; Music in State College, PA. I was
mostly looking backwards to explore the music of the past, but I was also
exploring the indie rock of the day with the help of Sirius Left of Center, NPR
Music, and the early music blogs. Access to funds, and the range of means to
discover good new music emboldened me to  This would be the year where I bought
my last CDs from the last remaining record club, Columbia House. It would also
be the last year where no album found a way into my collection digitally.</p>

<li><p><em>Extraordinary Machine</em> by <strong>Fiona Apple</strong> - This album had the strange
distinction of having leaked in full, in a very different form several years
before this official release. At the time, I very much preferred the most more
eccentric, almost mid-period <strong>Tom Waits</strong> sound of the first release, but I
have warmed up to the official version. What would get released by the label
was much closer to <em>When the Pawn…</em> which happens to be one of my favorite
records of all time. This is the last album before she destroyed her wonderful
voice with smoking. [<em>Memory</em>: At the time I felt so betrayed by the official
release that felt like it went against the out there wishes of the artist and
producer. We now know that at least some portion of the unofficial version was
made by fans based on an incomplete, in-progress cut.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>I Sold Gold</em> by <strong>Aqueduct</strong> - A lost classic that I feel very fortunate to
know about. Such a good natured, electro indie-pop record with huge hooks and
pretty melodies. This guy arrived with a full set of songwriting and home
production skills. I wish he has made more records. [<em>Memory</em>: Every now and
then Sirius Left of Center would become the champions of a relatively obscure
record that would get no play or attention anywhere else. I always wondered if
it was label relationships or DJ preferences that made this happen.
Regardless, I feel very fortunate to have hear the pop masterpiece “Gowing Up
With GNR” on the station back in ‘05.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Suspicious Activity?</em> by <strong>The Bad Plus</strong> - This live recording is rougher
around the edges than their other more conventional jazz recordings, and there
are far fewer “covers”. It is also my favorite. These, often wildly
improvisational, originals are a peak that I don’t think they would ever
replicate again. The opening track “Prehensile Dream” is about as exciting as
contemporary jazz has ever sounded. [<em>Memory</em>: This makes me miss XM Beyond
Jazz. That is where I discovered this band and album when I heard “Rhinoceros
Is My Profession” in early 2006. The format of that station made jazz feel
like a living, still in progress art form.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Push Barman to Open Old Wounds</em> by <strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong> - Actually an EP
compilation that covers roughly the decade preceding its release. This was the
first time I heard any of these tracks, and the originals are deleted from the
catalog…so this counts as a 2005 record! It is also my favorite release by
these guys. The spare, simplicity of the early EPs captures the charm of their
early chamber pop sound better than any of the LPs from the same era. Later
songs like “Jonathan David” feel like a preview of the 70s pop sounds that
would soon dominate their releases. [<em>Memory</em>: In the early days of collecting
vinyl, I found an original press of this collection, but I didn’t want to pay
$45 for it at the time. It is absurd to think about this given what records
cost now, but I would get a chance at a re-press almost a decade later.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Silent Alarm</em> by <strong>Bloc Party</strong> - A wonderful later work in the post-punk
revival scene. It follows on well from the UK Indie sounds of the early 2000s,
and layed down a blueprint for the “mainstream-indie” sound that would sell
many records in the next decade. These guys were ahead of the new wave revival
curve in a way that no-one seemed to notice at the time, especially on the
outstanding “Banquet”. [<em>Memory</em>: This album got tons of play on both Sirius
Left of Center, and Alt Nation, the clearest indication of indie’s growing
mainstream relevance.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Broken Social Scene</em> by <strong>Broken Social Scene</strong> - This Canadian indie
collective would eventually become too massive and unfocused for me, but this
record captured them at their peak. This is big music with layers and layers
of guitars and voices. Tracks like “7/4 (Shoreline)” show how indie-rock could
work simultaneously as innovative art-rock and easy to enjoy pop. [<em>Memory</em>:
In late 2005 Sirius Satellite Radio would start broadcasting Canadian content,
including an indie focussed station called “The Verge”. This was one of many
records I discovered there.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Aerial</em> by <strong>Kate Bush</strong> - I actively resisted this album (and artist) for
years. This record was massive at the time, particularly with the NPR Music
set. While I would learn to appreciate her early work in the 2010s, I didn’t
connect with this later album until pandemic times. This is an art rock album
that is so timeless, it would be impossible to place in any kind of era. More
of a return to the experimental sounds of her 3rd and 4th records, this leaves
behind much of the pop accessability of her late 80s peak. I can’t think of
anything more <strong>Kate Bush</strong> than singing the digits of Pi on the song of that
name. [<em>Memory</em>: For several months this was my album of choice, during my
morning walks in the middle of the COVID19 pandemic. This music has a sense of
isolation, with a soothing warmth that went well with the mood of that time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Plans</em> by <strong>Death Cab For Cutie</strong> - A terrific followup to a massive indie
success, and a major label debut. The first of many acts who would make this
transition, and one of the most successful. The production is a  bit sharper,
but otherwise this fits in well with their earlier work. These are all pretty
much ballads now, but they have always been their best at their most sappy. I
lost interest after this record. [<em>Memory</em>: One of the positive side effects
of these guys going to a major was that I could get this at Columbia House
prices. One of the last discs I would acquire that way.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Picaresque</em> by <strong>The Decemberists</strong> - This will always be the peak for me.
The perfect balance of their folky early stuff, and the later more
progressive, conceptual work. So many whimsical story songs about mariners,
bagmen, and barrow boys, I don’t know that anything else captures the wilful
dorkiness of 2000s indie rock. I love it. [<em>Memory</em>: This song seemed to
produce an unusually high number of “hit singles”. Indie music was everywhere
in those days, and every song that escaped the limited visibility of college
radio playlists was a winner. I knew about 5 songs already when I heard “16
Miliary Wives” on one of those music choice cable channels at a friends dinner
party. Somehow that was what sold me on these guys.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Green Cosmos</em> by <strong>Deerhoof</strong> - I think the two releases from this band would
highlight the two major threads of their sound. This one is maybe the most
whimsical thing they have produced. A particular kind of childlike weirdness
runs throughout the album. I mean it starts with a song that commands us to
“Come See The Duck”! The album is also mostly in Satomi’s native Japanese. It
is filled with keyboard riffs that make the <strong>Fiery Furnaces</strong> look tame by
comparison. [<em>Memory</em>: I don’t think I ever heard this before I bought the
vinyl reissue of it at Lakeshore Record Exchange on my first Record Store Day
in 2010.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Runners Four</em> by <strong>Deerhoof</strong> - One of the hardest rocking albums they
have ever made, yet there is always a undercurrent of gentle pop. This one
always has been a bit too long for me, but the highlights are very high.
“O’Malley, Former Underdog” is a particular favorite. [<em>Memory</em>: At the time,
eMusic was pricing albums per track. I remember this double album with all the
short songs feeling a bit spendy under that model, and I put it off for quite
a while.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Some Cities</em> by <strong>Doves</strong> - These guys were probably the most consistent act
to come out of the UK indie scene of the early 2000s. Not quite as good as
what came immediately before, but still a fine rock record. <strong>Radiohead</strong> had
brought synths and samples into alt-rock and bands like this took the idea to
wildly popular places. Like <strong>Coldplay</strong> but actually good. [<em>Memory</em>: I had
been interested in this band for some time due to satellite radio, but had
never checked out their stuff due to a lack of funds. With funds from my first
full-time job I was finally able to get their entire back-catalog in 2005,
when this was the latest release.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Blinking Lights and Other Revelations</em> by <strong>Eels</strong> - This record felt so huge
when it came out, but going on two decades later, it has almost completely
disappeared from public consciousness. It is a very subtle record of subdued
and very pretty songs that can be easy to forget. It is incredibly enjoyable
every time I do listen to it. A wide mixture of styles from late 90s style
alt-rock to piano based ballads, this is a sprawling double album in the
traditions of the late 60s. [<em>Memory</em>: This may be the album I have been
looking for on vinyl for the longest time. Some day I might just have to pull
the trigger on one of the expensive copies on discogs.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Room Noises</em> by <strong>Eisley</strong> - A bunch of weird kids from Texas making major
key <strong>Radiohead</strong> songs. The three sisters at the center of the group had a
remarkable combination of voices. This first record has a quaint kind of
childlike wonder that is really enjoyable. [<em>Memory</em>: I was on-board early as
their early EPs (particularly <em>Marvelous Things</em>) got serious play on Sirius
Left of Center in the summer of 2004. I even used some free download codes I
saved up from a McDonald’s promotion to download that EP from iTunes.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>You Could Have it So Much Better</em> by <strong>Franz Ferdinand</strong> - At the time I was
a little disappointed that this was so much like their first record, but given
the change in direction that would come after this, I’m now glad we got one
more in this style. In many ways the ultimate realization of the post-punk
revival sound, this could also be seen as the peak of UK Indie. “Walk Away” is
one of my very favorite songs. [<em>Memory</em>: When I was being on-boarded at my
new job, I saw a CD copy of this on the corner of one of my new colleague’s
desk. It was a good sign.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Demon Days</em> by <strong>Gorillaz</strong> - While this was certainly the most popular
project by <strong>Damon Albarn</strong> in the USA, it is far less interesting to me than
his other projects. That said, this album does more for me than the others
under this name. I think I am mostly drawn to the minimalist electronic beats
that point forward to the sound of <strong>The Good, The Bad, and the Queen</strong>.
[<em>Memory</em>: I probably wouldn’t have given this a chance except for a
recommendation that a good friend made during a conversation on AOL Instant
Messenger. I can’t think of a more early 2000s way to hear about a record.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fires In Distant Buildings</em> by <strong>Gravenhurst</strong> - A really pretty and somber
record. An early 2000s take on the slowcore genre with some occasional uptempo
tracks for contrast. Incredibly beautiful but sad. [<em>Memory</em>: I had been
interested in slowcore for several years, and in late 2005 I had access to the
early Pandora with its Music Genome Project to explore the genre further. I
think I found out about this record via a <strong>Red House Painters</strong> seeded
channel that played the <strong>Kinks</strong> cover “See My Friends”.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Employment</em> by <strong>The Kaiser Chiefs</strong> - It is easy to see these guys as a
follow-on act to the <strong>Franz Ferdinand</strong> sound, but there are some old time
rock and roll elements here that give a very different feel. I think how much
a person is going to enjoy this record is dependent on how they feel about “la
la la la” style singalong choruses. Leeds UK definitely had a sound in the
mid-aughts and it pretty much was being drunk in the pub and screaming along
with the jukebox. [<em>Memory</em>: I wish I could remember the sequence of events
that led me to these guys. I know I saw them at Live 8. I drove through the
night with one of my co-workers to arrive at the fundraiser concert in
Philadelphia, and they were the first band on, shortly after noon. The singles
off of this were certainly getting some serious play on Sirius. I also know
that I had to import this record before it was commonly available in the USA.
I just can’t remember what order these things happened in.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Not Them, You</em> by <strong>Lake Trout</strong> - A fusion of post-punk, shoegaze, and
<strong>Radiohead</strong> style art-rock, it is hard to believe they started out a jazzy
jam band. In many ways the most representative record of the early 2000s on
this list, but also one of the most obscure. “Shiny Wrapper” is a stunning
opener, and the record manages to keep the level high throughout. [<em>Memory</em>: I
found out about these guys when their prior album was shared by a friend at a
former job, during a CDR exchange. I really miss finding out about new music
from friends, that never happens anymore as a fully grown adult.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>LCD Soundsystem</em> by <strong>LCD Soundsystem</strong> - The genesis of “indie dance music” and a
record that both seems more and less important than we thought at the time. I
don’t know that this band was ever the game changer the press made them out to
be, yet this record definitely showed a generation of Brooklyn bands that the
indie kids, they want to dance. [<em>Memory</em>: One of the first really big buzz
records from the indie era. The single “Losing My Edge” and copious blog hype
had set this up for a new kind of indie fame. It was kind of weird for a
relatively unknown band to launch their first album with a companion disc of
bonus content.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Frances the Mute</em> by <strong>The Mars Volta</strong> - Another terrific modern day prog
record from these guys. Everything from the cover, to the song-titles feels
like a reverential throwback to acts like <strong>Rush</strong> and <strong>Pink Floyd</strong>, but
the sound is very much rooted in post-hardcore. [<em>Memory</em>: It is hard to
remember now, but there was a time when the RateYourMusic charts were
dominated by various neo prog outfits. These guys continue to rank high, and I
think it is because the kind of post-hardcore this is derived from is still
valued as RYM becomes more concerned with what is “cool”.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Chaos and Creation in the Backyard</em> - A contemporary review of this album
made the apt observation that the last several records that he had made
(starting with at least <em>Flaming Pie</em>) had been perceived as comeback albums.
That said, this is where things seemed to stick and he was considered a
relevant active artist in a way that continues until when I write this (2022).
I think maybe this is where Paul first realized the direct connections between
the eccentric pop music he had been making for decades and what the indie kids
were up to. This album is clearly aware of the connections, and as a result it
feels of the moment in a way that is remarkable for someone at this point in
their career. [<em>Memory</em>: Paul had always been my favorite Beatle. Suddenly
after the release of this record, that was no longer uncool.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Live it Out</em> by <strong>Metric</strong> - I’ve always preferred the solo stuff by <strong>Emily
Haines</strong> but there is a lot to like here in the finely produced indie-rock of
her band. I do miss the edge that these earlier records have, but I’m not
going to fault them for pursuing the mainstream fame that their increasingly
slick sound would bring in the years ahead. [<em>Memory</em>: One of the first CDs I
remember buying from Mike’s Movies and Music in State College, and one of my
first discoveries from Sirius 97 The Verge.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cathedrals</em> by <strong>Millbrook</strong> - When I think of this EP I realize there must
be thousands, if not tens of thousands of records I would love, but I will
never hear. This super obscure record is the perfect combination of Beatles
pop and early 2000s indie, and I wish there was lots more of this. [<em>Memory</em>:
I discovered this, like I’m sure 99% of the others who know about it, when it
was featured on NPR All Songs Considered. This was the first time they broke
something completely obscure, that owes its limited space in the popular
consciousness to that 30 second segment in a popular weekly podcast.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Z</em> by <strong>My Morning Jacket</strong> - Alt country was in decline by 2005, and these
guys were one of the last big names before the genre would become
unfashionable. This record is already a half step towards the straight ahead
indie-rock that they, and many of their peers would pivot to in the years
ahead. The result is their finest work. [<em>Memory</em>: NPR All Songs Considered
was becoming embarrassingly influential on my tastes around this time. I was
already a big fan of their song “Dancefloors” which was a favorite from my
early days listening to satellite radio. Hearing “Off the Record” on that NPR
podcast was what really got me into these guys for a bit.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Weight is a Gift</em> by <strong>Nada Surf</strong> - One of the great records that came
out in the early 2000s from a 90s indie band joining in with the new kids.
Really great pop songs with jangly guitars. [<em>Memory</em>: I found out about these
guys when I heard the song “Always Love” on the Liquid Todd show on Sirius Alt
Nation. The show was on at 10 PM to Midnight Saturday night, and was an
interesting combination of electronic music and indie rock that was very to my
tastes. I found out about a lot of great things there.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Twin Cinema</em> by <strong>The New Pornographers</strong> - This was my point of entry for
this band. In many ways it does the best way of capturing what makes them
great. The sharp pop songs, the sweet ballads, the wonderful harmonies. More
than anything it does a great job highlighting the strengths of the three main
contributors to the songwriting. [<em>Memory</em>: This reminds me of the first
apartment I had after my new job, my first without a roommate. I listened to
this disc all the time using my home theater DVD player (as was the custom at
the time).]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Deadwing</em> by <strong>Porcupine Tree</strong> - A return to more proggy sounds after a few
albums of alt rock, and the most recent album which was on the gentle side of
metal. That said there are still some hints of the lighter alt mid-tempo alt
rock in “Lazarus” and the heavier sounds in “Shallow”. In many ways this is a
great summary of why these guys are one of my favorite bands of the last 25
years. [<em>Memory</em>: At the time, this was my favorite album of the year. I tend
to underestimate how I feel about this one, I really still love it. In fact I
imported a vinyl copy as I wrote this paragraph.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Work</em> by <strong>Sound Team</strong> - Another case where a band’s first EP is by far
their finest moment. The rough around the edges post-punk on offer here is far
more interesting than what would come on their debut LP. “The Fastest Man
Alive” is still their best song. More post-punk revival bands should have
featured the organ like these guys and <strong>The Walkmen</strong>. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought my
CD copy of this after seeing them open for <strong>Death Cab for Cutie</strong> at the
Bryce Jordan Center on the Penn State Campus. I’m glad I did, as this is way
out of print now.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Gimme Fiction</em> by <strong>Spoon</strong> - The last of their early albums, and the last
one with their trademark minimalist sound. Still the ultimate realization of
piano forward indie rock, with some create guitar accents. Not their most
consistent record, but still a great listen [<em>Memory</em>: The song that led me to
these guys was “I Turn My Camera On”, which I heard on Sirius and immediately
sought out the record. Interestingly the Krautrock groove that pulled me in is
not very representative of their other work, which I ended up liking as well.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Illinois</em> by <strong>Sufjan Stevens</strong> [<strong>2005 Favorite</strong>] - The fanciest folk
record ever made. Some incredible songs came out of the state based theme, and
the range of instrumentation and styles is staggering. The band that he
assembled for this record is something else, and many, many of these folks are
off doing great things in various projects across the rock and classical
worlds. It is hard to see this as anything other  than than 2000s indie’s
greatest moment. [<em>Memory</em>: This is another highly rated record that I
resisted for a while because of all the hype. It was the heartbreaking
“Casimir Pulaski Day” that changed my mind. That story of a deeply religious
young person questioning their faith after seeing their first love die of
cancer is one of the very best songs of all time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Loon</em> by <strong>Tapes ‘n Tapes</strong> - Another band that took the indie post-punk
revival sound and added some additional, interesting elements. These guys like
to mess with rhythm, and use heavy distortion on the guitars and vocals in a
way that isn’t psychedelic but edgy. All their work has been very good, but
this debut is still their top effort. [<em>Memory</em>: I always assumed these guys
were Canadian, given their sound, and they even made a song called “Manitoba”.
Turns out they are from Minnesota. Close enough I guess.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Team Sleep</em> by <strong>Team Sleep</strong> - Such a cool record. It uses electronics,
samples, and atmosphere to turn millennial alt-rock into something way more
interesting. Way better than the primary related band, <strong>Deftones</strong>, I wish
they made more music for this wonderful side project. Every time I play this
record, I’m struck by how interesting and enjoyable it is. [<em>Memory</em>: This is
the only time in my life I discovered an album by one of the most cliche ways
out there. I walked into the State College FYE at the old Nittany Mall, and
heard this playing in the background. I went up to the counter and asked what
it was, and they pointed to the jewel case on the counter. I walked out with
this disc.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em> by <strong>Wolf Parade</strong> - This is another of the
indie bands out of the post-punk revival set who would make progressively more
complex and diverse music as their albums progress. I much prefer the earlier
simpler stuff. Admittedly, they started out with some wonderfully eccentric
pop elements, but it was just enough on this one. [<em>Memory</em>: This was one of
the first records that really directed my attention to the “Canadian
Renaissance” already in progress. Thanks to Sirius The Verge I was hearing
this stuff very early. This was the point where it started to feel like only
our northern neighbors could still make good guitar based indie rock like
this.]</p></li>

<h2>2006<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I look at the picture below I’m struck by how many different ways I
discovered these records. Some of these were the latest releases from acts I had
been following for some time, but mostly they were completely new things. There
are songs I heard on Sirius or XM satellite radio. There are things that were
the hot albums on the indie music blogs of the day. There were small indie
releases that were recommended by eMusic. There are 3 (!) albums that I
discovered watching a UK music countdown show, repackaged as cheap filler
content on the obscure US Cable network, HDNet. There is a album with a track I
heard on a iMac commercial. Some of these were the top records on RateYourMusic,
back when tastes were a little different there (more indie and mainstream). I
was still using the AllMusic guide to do genre studies (in this case post-rock).
There is an album I ran out and bought on the drive home from the local brewpub,
where I heard it playing in the background.</p>
<p>This is also the year where I have by far the most releases that I would like
to own on vinyl that I do not. In many cases, these records never saw a vinyl
release, and are obscure enough that one is not likely to ever happen. As a
result, there is quite the unsightly stack-up of CDs on the side of the image.
This almost encapsulates the unsightliness of the CD as a format. The art is too
small to be appreciated, and no matter how well you tried to take care of those
jewel cases they are scratched up and a little cracked. Many of those discs were
bought at City Lights Records, where I had started to shop when my old favorite
store, Mike’s Movies and Music had closed. Many came from Amazon, in some cases
imported from the UK (a new practice that I had adopted). One of these CDs, was
imported from the UK by myself personally!</p>
<p>More than anything I’m looking at the image below and feeling powerful waves of
nostalgia. This was the music of my younger self. A person I can relate to, but
no longer completely am. I glad that I can always revisit my former self though
these albums.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2006.jpg"><img alt="My 2006 favorite albums" src="../_images/2006.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Beach House</em> by <strong>Beach House</strong> - Listening to this is quite startling
knowing the band they are today. This is a much smaller, slower, and
meandering record than what they do now. This slight record was certainly
enough to get me interested back then, and I still really like it today.
[<em>Memory</em>: I found out about these guys as an eMusic recommended artist. I
remember Greg at city lights being impressed how ahead of the scene I was that
time. I also remember buying my vinyl copy at Amoeba records in San Francisco
in 2009 and being surprised that they were making vinyl reissues of relatively
recent indie records.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Life Pursuit</em> by <strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong> - It is hard to remember now,
but this was a controversial record when it came out. The transition to
straight ahead pop they had started on their previous record was now complete.
Everyone missed the half-folk and chamber elements, and it was widely regarded
as sub-par. I really enjoyed these back to basics pop songs back then, and
now consider this their finest record. This was also the album when Stevie
Jackson and Sarah Martin really started to play a larger, and quite welcome
role in the band. The mix of the three primary vocalists had become the
signature sound of the band. It was almost like they had become a more twee
and gentle <strong>New Pornographers</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Let’s Get Out Of This Country</em> by <strong>Camera Obscura</strong> - The Scots understand
indie pop like no other nation on earth. This might be the finest record in
the whole genre. Back when hit indie records were a thing, this was one of the
biggest. Everywhere from Pitchfork, Stereogum, NPR Music, and Spin wanted you
to listen to this thing. Every service recommended it as a download, and it
climbed the RateYourMusic charts in a way music like this can’t anymore. Holds
up. [<em>Memory</em>: This was the first real concert I attended in Rochester, NY. I
remember walking down the German house in 2009, and being excited that I could
see bands like this in the town I lived in. This would be the beginning of
three great years of shows.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Crane Wife</em> by <strong>The Decemberists</strong> - This was the start of a new phase
for a band that always liked drama, but now were completely centered on
telling grand stories. A little preview of the proggyness that would fully
form on the next one, this was still mostly the indie-folk of the first three
records. This whole record tells a story that I’ve never been able to follow,
but it doesn’t matter because the songs are so strong. A great guest spot by
<strong>Laura Veirs</strong> on “Yankee Bayonet” as well. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember this being
voted the top album of 2006 by NPR listeners and feeling a little bit old that
my tastes aligned with that group. It isn’t my favorite from the year any
longer, but it is close!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Victory of the Comic Muse</em> by <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> - After a couple more
serious records, Neil Hannon allows himself a little levity again. One of the
very last of his records for me to warm up to, it joins the rest of the
catalog as a favorite. He is probably the most consistent artist I know of.
[<em>Memory</em>: I think I had only heard this once or twice before buying the
entire vinyl reissue series.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Bright Lights and What I Should Have Learned</em> by <strong>Duels</strong> - A late entry
in the UK indie scene, it is a mostly guitar based Brit-pop derivative sound
with a sprinkling of the keyboards the USA kids were getting into. I think it
was because this sat uncomfortably between UK indie and the contemporary
mainstream sound that this didn’t really find an audience despite being a
really crisply put together record with some interesting sounds. Weirdly, this
sounds a bit like the kind of “mindie” music that was about to become very
widely popular in the USA. [<em>Memory</em>: I found out about these guys by watching
“London Live” a repackaging of a UK countdown show that was filler material
for an early HDTV channel called HDNet. The performance of  the song “Animal”
had an really fresh, dance-able sound that seemed to anticipate what was about
to come in North American Indie.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tuesday Wonderland</em> by <strong>Esbjorn Svensson Trio</strong> - In the 2000s jazz
experienced a new kind of fusion, this time with indie and experimental rock
music. These guys made several of the most important records in the movement.
The startling <strong>Radiohead</strong>-esque “Fading Maid Preludium/Postludium” bookends
a set of music that is only slightly more in line with conventional Piano
jazz. The releases after this would get a little too difficult for me, and
this is the one where the balance between artistry and accessability was most
to my liking. [<em>Memory</em>: I was spending so much time looking for music, that a
fairly obscure record like this one was coming at me from multiple angles. A
featured album by NPR music, I was also hearing this on the Beyond Jazz
channel on XM radio. I think one of the reasons I like my favorites so much
from this era, is that I really picked them from a large number of things I
had heard.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>S/T</em> by <strong>Electric President</strong> - One of the records that followed on from the
gentle indie-electronic sound of <strong>The Postal Service</strong>, but this one was much
slower and more somber. I also like how these guys played around with song
structure, there are bridges and unexpected transitions everywhere. This was
really interesting stuff that never found the audience it deserved. [<em>Memory</em>:
I had been a subscriber to Sirius Satellite radio since the summer of 2003,
and it had become a primary influence on my listening. I had always heard that
XM had a much wider playlist, but didn’t really have a full appreciation until
I heard some XM jazz programming during an Orange Bowl trip in early 2006. I
immediately subscribed upon my return, and “Good Morning, Hypocrite” from this
record was one of the first tracks I heard on their indie station, XMU. I can
almost still picture that song title in the saved track list on my portable
XM receiver sitting on the dash of my old Purple Dodge Neon. I miss the old
XM.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bitter Tea</em> by the <strong>Fiery Furnaces</strong> - This is one of those records where I
never understood the prevailing opinion. Somehow this is perceived to be the
impenetrably difficult and dense follow-up. If anything this takes the
experimentation and proggy-ness of <strong>Blueberry Boat</strong> and adds back in the
strong pop component of the early stuff. Things like “Waiting to Know You” do
an amazing job balancing the weirdness with the sweetness. I like this record
way more than 95% of the human population. [<em>Memory</em>: This was the time when
you could buy an unpopular record on vinyl at a steep discount. I don’t know
if I even paid 10 bucks for a nice new copy of this.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Just Like the Fambly Cat</em> by <strong>Grandaddy</strong> - It took me a while, but I came
to appreciate the last record from the first tenure of these guys. Some
serious punk aggression (especially on the hardcore homage “50%”) has been
added to the usual low-key, often downtrodden psych-pop. This would have been
a great statement to end on, and I haven’t liked what has come since nearly as
much. [<em>Memory</em>: I listened to this a lot on headphones around the time I
lived in my little Park Ave apartment. I still like to crank it through cans
every now and then. The fuzz sounds great that way.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Yellow House</em> by <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong> - I didn’t like this very much when it
first came out to great acclaim. I connected much more with the next record,
which featured far more conventional songs. I think after I had that blueprint
to follow, I could better appreciate this more abstract work. [<em>Memory</em>: This
was strangely difficult to hear for a massive indie hit. It wasn’t on eMusic,
and I don’t recall ever seeing the CD appear at City Lights (or Best Buy). It
was also out of print on vinyl for a shockingly long time, until I got the
re-issue that came out in 2022.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Knives Don’t Have Your Back</em> by <strong>Emily Haines</strong> - [<strong>2006 FAVORITE</strong>] - A
stunning piano based singer-songwriter record, that is completely unlike
anything else I have ever heard. I really think she saves her very best stuff
for the rare solo releases, and this outclasses anything from <strong>Metric</strong> by a
fair margin. The production on this record is quite exceptional as well, and
the dreamy mix really adds a lot to the impact of the top notch lyrics.
[<em>Memory</em>: I became aware of this album via a post of the excellent video for
“Doctor Blind” on Pitchfork. The artist is strolling through an empty
department store in a creepy scene that really complements a fairly profound
song about the over-prescription of anti-depressants.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Day I Turned to Glass</em> by <strong>Honeycut</strong> - A delightful anomaly: hip hop
influenced indie rock made by a classically trained cellist. I don’t think
this ever found its audience, and I’m not sure it really has much of one. I
really like it though. Listening today, it sounds a bit ahead of it’s time and
it fits in well with what is going on in the frontier of R&amp;B. [<em>Memory</em> I
discovered this ]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Howling Bells</em> by <strong>Howling Bells</strong> - I had been enjoying this record for the
better part of a year when someone pointed out to me that it is a bit of a
country record. They were right. It is dark kind of country made by
Australians, but country nonetheless. This was back when the Bella Union label
seemed like it was trending towards some sort of modern day 4AD, and this fits
right in with that. “Setting Sun” is one of my favorite songs of all time.
[<em>Memory</em>: I really struggled to acquire this record. This was another band I
discovered on HDNet’s “London Live” show. Their performance was a little
rough, but I liked it enough to DVR it and watch it over and over again. I
remember waiting for a 2007 US release that didn’t happen, and I couldn’t find
a way to import the disc from the UK on Amazon. Eventually I would buy a copy
from HMV on my first trip to london in March 2007 and hand carry it back to
the USA myself.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Return to Sea</em> by <strong>Islands</strong> - I like this even more than the much loved
<strong>Unicorns</strong> LP, as the more serious tone does it for me. Plenty of whimsey
still here, but the epic indie-pop of “Swans (Life After Death)” was a welcome
expansion of the wounds used by that prior band. Even “Rough Gem” manages to
be silly in a far more epic way. This is big indie-pop. [<em>Memory</em>: Another XMU
discovery, the expanded playlist of my new satellite radio service was
expanding my music collection.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Silent Shout</em> by <strong>The Knife</strong> - The kind of music only Scandinavians can
make properly. Creepy atmospheric, yet highly melodic and certainly not the
least bit danceable. This is the electronic music of calm reflection in a dark
room. [<em>Memory</em>: This was the first time I can remember resisting a Pitchfork
hype record out of principle. When I finally relented, it was very clearly an
amazing record.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Everything Wrong is Imaginary</em> by <strong>Lilys</strong> - The Elephant6 adjacent band
from Philly ends on a very high note. The superior of the two records to come
out of their third phase. The sharply produced shoegazy indie-pop on offer
puts to shame the myriad of new bands working in this territory at the time.
[<em>Memory</em>: After this record came out I assumed it was the start of a glorious
comeback for this guy. I didn’t realize it was the end.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Someone to Drive You Home</em> by <strong>The Long Blondes</strong> - Very derivative of the
long history of post-punk and new wave, but the execution is perfect. In
retrospect this can almost be seen as the period on the post-punk revival.
This is where the new wave revival and imaginary 80s began. [<em>Memory</em>: I have
always been unable to process exactly how much I like this record for some
reason. When it was getting good press back in ‘06 I was so resistant to it.
When I reviewed my candidates when making this list, I was tempted to leave it
off. After half a listen I was rushing off to find a vinyl copy on discogs.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Pretty Little Head</em> by <strong>Nellie Mckay</strong> - Another double album genre
experiment, this time on an indie label, where this belongs. Less white girl
rapping, and what remains is well done. The genres here are more looking back
on Broadway and cabaret music, with some alt rock thrown in. [<em>Memory</em>: One of
the first records I remember buying on eMusic. It was very surprising to see
her on an indie, though it certainly made far more sense than this kind of
thing being on Columbia. I had started using the eMusic platform in 2006 and
its subscription based buffet was becoming very influential in my tastes.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>You Are There</em> by <strong>Mono</strong> - Post-rock was a very tired scene by 2006, and
these guys were one of the last great bands to emerge. Somewhere between the
shimmering guitars of <strong>Explosions in the Sky</strong> and the chaotic strings of
<strong>Godspeed You! Great Emperor</strong> maybe the last listenable combination of
elements left to cover. Their finest record, with their definitive track
“Moonlight”. [<em>Memory</em>: This album, and particularly the track “Moonlight” was
one of the great rediscoveries while making this list. I streamed it during a
morning walk during a review of the albums on the bubble for the year. I
probably streamed it half a dozen more times that day.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Black Holes and Other Revelations</em> by <strong>Muse</strong> - This was the record that
would finally break these guys in America, more due to better promotion than
any shift in sound or quality. Still very big alt-rock music, with perhaps a
bit more of the <strong>Queen</strong> style theatrics. The hit “Supermassive Back Hole”
introduces a funky kind of groove that would hit at the broader template that
would be used in the next few records. Looking back, this probably was the
peak of their first era, and it makes me a little sad since I don’t like their
new direction quite as much. [<em>Memory</em>: Another time when I got to feel a bit
ahead of my time thanks to the expanded playlist of satellite radio.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bring Me the Workhorse</em> by <strong>My Brightest Diamond</strong> - I became aware of Shara
Nova through her work with <strong>Sufjan Stevens</strong> and <strong>The Decemberists</strong>, which
led me to her solo catalog. Her debut is a subdued, and often moody record. At
times it feels like a gentler, more classically trained <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> album.
I don’t listen to this as much as her later work, but it is still a great one.
[<em>Memory</em>: In the early days of my vinyl collecting, I could still buy back
stock first pressings of records that weren’t big sellers. That is how I got
this one around 2010.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>He Poos Clouds</em> by <strong>Owen Pallett</strong> - I became aware of this record on the
Pitchfork best of 2006 list, so I gave it a download on eMusic. They compared
it to <strong>Andrew Bird</strong>, but aside from the violin, I don’t know why. This is
some very out there, art-rock that is heavily influenced by contemporary
classical music. I liked bits of it at the time, I love it now. A complex and
difficult album, and a first class performance and recording. [<em>Memory</em>: This
along with <strong>Shara Nova</strong> was my gateway into contemporary classical. It was
very sneaky how they got me to accept the complex sounds by wrapping it in pop
songs.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Writer’s Block</em> by <strong>Peter, Bjorn, and John</strong> - “Hey Google, play the hipster
whistling song.” This was the first time that an indie artist made a song that
felt like it was designed for commercials. This was the genesis of mainstream
indie (or mindie as Carles liked to call it). That does nothing to tarnish an
outstanding indie pop record, and really it only helped to elevate the status,
and increase the production of great indie-pop records. [<em>Memory</em>: I heard
(the now legendary) “Young Folks” for the first time when it was playing in
the background of Otto’s Pub and Brewery, my hangout at the time. I stopped at
Best Buy on the way home, hoping to find a CD copy. I came home with what
would become one of my favorite records of the year.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>We Are the Pipettes</em> by <strong>The Pipettes</strong> - In the mid 2000s, there were
constantly new genres of indie that were going to be the next big thing, but
produced a few big records before fading away. “Pre-Beatles pop-music” was
such an animal, and the 60s girl groups were an obvious place find
inspiration. In retrospect this does seem like the kind of gimmick that
wouldn’t last long, but what a glorious debut record. They sing in an
untrained but pure tone that sounds great together. The pop songwriting is
great, especially on the classic “Pull Shapes”. [<em>Memory</em>: Yet another band
that I discovered on HDNet London Live. It was such a surprise to see such an
out there concept get any attention at all. I remember having Greg at City
Lights order me a copy of their first US EP, and him asking me “so is this
like a 60s girl group or something?” Kinda, but not exactly in a way that
really, really worked for a short time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Operation: Mindcrime II</em> by <strong>Queensryche</strong> - What a huge surprise. A sequel
to one of my favorite albums of all time arrived, and it was far better than I
could have imagined. A remarkable return to the classic sound of this band, we
now know it mostly a Geoff Tate solo album. It would have been impossible to
achieve the same high level of the original, but this is about 75% the
quality, which is still very, very good. More than anything it takes the story
to a new place, that somehow makes the first record more interesting from a
narrative perspective. [<em>Memory</em>: I hadn’t thought much about these guys in
years when I heard that this was coming out. Thanks to this record I would
re-engage with their back-catalog and they would become one of my all-time
favorites.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Classics</em> by <strong>Ratatat</strong> - Instrumental rock that is very much not post-rock,
this whimsical record is more like the modern <strong>Ventures</strong>. One of those bands
where every album is very similar, and I only end up caring about their very
best effort. [<em>Memory</em>: In 2007, I went on a bus tour of the Irish
countryside north of Dublin. I remember a rich doctor was there with his wife
and adult son who was wearing a Ratatat shirt. Why do I remember this, I don’t
know. I’ve got nothing else for here.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hello Everything</em> by <strong>Squarepusher</strong> - His records had been expanding to
include more and more elements, and the title of this one seems to recognize a
peak had been reached. After this he would bite off a bit more than he could
chew, but the eclecticism works out well here. The jazz influenced electronica
of “Planetarium” is a particular favorite, and probably the high point for
this guy. [<em>Memory</em>: I found out about this artist on XM Beyond Jazz, where I
heard “Modern Jazz Guitar”. The early XM was a great platform, and while I am
still a happy customer of the modern SiriusXM, I miss those old stations with
their edge case genres, and massive, handcrafted playlists.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>A Lesson in Crime</em> by <strong>Tokyo Police Club</strong> - Sometimes a band’s first work
is their best, and in this case it is a 17 minute long EP. The rawness and
rough edges are a positive here, and it is almost like they ruined themselves
by started to understand what they were doing. This is pure garage, the sounds
of kids who don’t completely know how to make rock music, but do so pretty
effectively anyway. The songs are strange and wonderful, particularly the
charmingly amateurish science fiction of “Citizens of Tomorrow”. They would
never come close to this again. This is my favorite EP of all time. [<em>Memory</em>:
I saw the band play an opening set as “the next big thing” in a packed to the
gills basement club in Temple Bar Dublin. They played the EP in sequence and
nothing more. They pulled a girl up from the crowd to sing the one line of
female vocals from “Nature of the Experiment”. A buzz band at their peak, and
I was glad to be there.]</p></li>

<h2>2007<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I had a sense that when I got to this year, I would have a bit to say in the
introduction text, but didn’t anticipate all the topics that would come to mind.
This was a pivotal year for the music industry, and for me as a listener. These
two things are not coincidental. The MP3 had almost a decade to destroy the model
for pop music that had existed since the late 1960s, and at least initially,
what was left in the ashes was wonderful. By 2007, portable media had made the
MP3 a practical means for music consumption in almost all contexts. In
mainstream music, the single was now again king, but album based rock music was
somehow stronger than ever. Digital distribution had raised awareness of indie
acts that in previous decades would have mostly toiled in obscurity and at best
might have been the favorites of music nerds, and then only retrospectively
be discovered by listeners at large. In this era of music blogs, the obscure could
rapidly become ubiquitous, and attention was getting drawn to increasingly
diverse models of what rock music could be.</p>
<p>The way I was consuming music was changing rapidly, but I clung to the old ways
out of nostalgic stubbornness. Like most people my age I had accumulated a
significant and very not-legit collection of MP3s. Around this time in my life,
I started to assemble a legit recreation and expansion of these illicit files. I
was using an expanded pallette of (legal) means to acquire and curate a rapidly
growing collection. This was the golden age of the subscription/buffet pricing
scheme at eMusic, who for a nominal fee (15-20 dollars a month) could provide a
path to 10 or more indie label releases in digital format. At the time, I had
started to buy my first digital albums from Amazon, but digital was eclipsed by
CDs which were still the main way music was fining its way into my collection. I
would visit City Lights records every Tuesday during my lunch break and leave
with a clutch of the latest releases and likely a bunch of catalog titles I had
special ordered. These were the first crys of “the CD is dead” but I wasn’t
listening. I kept detailed records of every release that made it into my
collection regardless of format and I know that the first album I bought
(<em>Hissing Fauna, Are you the Destroyer?</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong>) was the 900th item
cataloged. A full 372 albums later, the 1272nd record (<em>Weirdo Rippers</em> by <strong>No
Age</strong>) would be logged, surely the most music I have ever acquired in a single
calendar year.</p>
<p>Most of the music I was listening to was still from years gone by, but I was
listening to more new music than I had ever done before. I have an interesting
artifact from this time, the first comprehensive attempt I ever made at a best
of the year list as a full grown adult. It isn’t the final version (unfortunately
lost to time) but an in progress version that I sent to myself via E-mail. I
remember working on this list during my lunch breaks at work during the last
months of the year, and I was sending it home to complete there over the holiday
break. At this point, I owned and could assess 79 different releases! I know
what I considered to be my top 25 records at that time, and 20 of those still
make my modern list. This is a much higher ratio than what would survive from my
2009 favorites (see below), and I think this is a product of my ability to still
listen with a kind of focus that the copious consumption facilitated by digital
streaming would soon destroy.</p>
<p>One of the five records that appeared on that original list of favorites that
doesn’t appear on my modern list feels like a case study in everything mentioned
above. <em>In Rainbows</em> by <strong>Radiohead</strong> was the first “pay what you want”, DRM
free, digital release by a major, internationally famous rock band. Admittedly,
they were a famous rock band that didn’t seem very interested in being famous.
At the time I have no doubt that I included it on my list because I thought that
it was an important release, and 15 years later, I am convinced that it is one
of the most important releases there has ever been. That said, it isn’t a great
album. Interestingly, as a band that became famous for working in the long form,
it was mostly a miss as a long player. There are some killer singles on there
though, and “Reckoner” is probably my favorite song of all-time from them, and
one of the most beautiful rock songs ever made. It is hard to view this album
separate from the context in which it was released, and I can’t of a better way
to summarize where pop music was in 2007 and my relationship with it.</p>

<li><p><em>Pocket Symphony</em> by <strong>Air</strong> - A colder more somber record from these guys
that fits in very well with their other work. It is happy to sit in the
background in a way their other records do not. That icy, sterile album cover
is a perfect summary. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember Greg from City Lights Records
telling me he liked to put this on as he was starting his day in the store.
That sounds just right to me.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>American Doll Posse</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - This was the beginning of a Tori
revival for me, and the start of a revival for the artist. I think playing a
few “alternate roles” for the concept of this record was freeing, and we got
something considerably more interesting than what had come immediately before.
Every album since this one has been a winner. So many different styles on this
record from the mid-tempo singer-songwriter fare of “Bouncing Off of Clouds”
to the rocking “Teenage Hustling” to the classic devastating story song
balladry of “Roosterspur Bridge”. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw Tori for the first time on
this tour, when it came to Pittsburgh. It was a halloween show and the crowd
really took the costume thing very seriously.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>New Magnetic Wonder</em> by <strong>The Apples in Stereo</strong> - I was very into Elephant 6
at the time and was very interested that one of the original bands was still
making new music. This was the first of two records in a a very <strong>ELO</strong> style,
with some weird atonal experiments thrown in. Some stunning pop music, that
makes me sad that Robert Schnieder has largely retired from performing.
[<em>Memory</em>: At the time I didn’t like the shift to <strong>Jeff Lynne</strong> territory,
but wow do I prefer it to the garage psych of their early records now.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Or Give Me Death</em> by <strong>Aqueduct</strong> - Even more than the first record, this
album sounds a bit like what would happen if <strong>Modest Mouse</strong> went full blown
pop. Some really interesting, intricate songs. I really wish more folks had
found these guys so they could have made more music. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw them as
an opening act at Water Street, a few years after this record came out. I
think I was the only one who was familiar with their stuff. Great show.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Neon Bible</em> by <strong>Arcade Fire</strong> - Until the awful <strong>Everything Now</strong> was
released, this was my least favorite of their albums. Unlike that mess, I
still really like this one. It was never going to live up to the incredible
debut, but there is a lot here to like. I especially enjoy the church organ
and pomp of “Intervention” and “My Body is a Cage”. [<em>Memory</em>: I waited a
really long time to buy this one on vinyl. I’m not sure why, as this is a
brilliant record that sounds great on the analog format.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mirrored</em> by <strong>Battles</strong> - A really cool, percussion forward post-rock album.
Not quite math rock, but still lots of interesting rhythms. They would never
make something this interesting again. [<em>Memory</em>: This kind of defines the
line for an album I like, but don’t need to own on vinyl. I’ve considered it
many times, but really digital is good enough for this. Why, I’m not exactly
sure.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Flying Club Cup</em> by <strong>Beirut</strong> - One of those bands, where I like much of
their music, but love only a few things. This is by far my favorite of their
records. It is a much stronger statement with solid songwriting throughout. “A
Sunday Smile” has those nostalgic, highly melodic, feel good vibes that is
their best sound. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw Owen Pallet join them on some of these
tunes at Pitchfork 2009, and it is the moment you see in the banner above.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>..are the Dark Horse</em> by <strong>The Besnard Lakes</strong> - A really nice low-fi, psych
record with some cool little <strong>Beach Boys</strong> elements. They would milk this
formula to good effect for a few more records, but this will always be my
favorite. “For Agent 13” is my favorite use of shortwave numbers stations in a
song. [<em>Memory</em>: When I started buying vinyl records, this was one of the
first recent releases I picked up. It was also one of the first records that
made me realize the shortcomings of vinyl production, when it arrived covered
in scuffs.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Armchair Apocrypha * by **Andrew Bird*</em> - I know many people consider this
the inferior follow-up, but I prefer it to anything else in his catalog. I
think it focusses more on straight ahead indie rock in a way that serves the
purpose well. The slick use of the looper and strings is still there, but the
songs are sharper and catchier. That said, this isn’t something I am
revisiting often today. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw him on this tour at the State Theater
in State College, PA. I really enjoyed the show. Only a few years later I saw
him in Rochester and it was awful. Had the performance changed, or had I?]</p></li>
<li><p><em>23</em> by <strong>Blonde Redhead</strong> - A really nice midpoint between dream-pop and
straight ahead indie rock. I didn’t realize it at the time since I was
discovering them well into their career, but this is the sound of an “old
indie” band updating their sound to fit right in with the new scene of the
moment. [<em>Memory</em>: I have to admit, I bought this as much for the striking
cover as for the solid reviews. Surely one of the last times I picked a record
that way?]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Andorra</em> by <strong>Caribou</strong> - It doesn’t seem like it today, because this kind of
thing is everywhere now, but this kind of psychedelic, electronic thing was
very innovative at the time. He would have two great records after this, but
this was the peak. A great mix of pop and experimentation. [<em>Memory</em>: I’m a
bit ashamed to admit that back in these days I was getting almost anything
Pitchfork gave BNM to that sounded half wise interesting. The indie stuff was
all on Emusic, and an album was about 2-3 bucks there. It was worth it to even
hate listen the thing. This one really worked out.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Friend Opportunity</em> by <strong>Deerhoof</strong> - My first record of theirs, and still my
favorite. The perfect mix of the punk aggression and the pop cuteness. The
definitive early 2000s indie band at their peak. Such complex, unusual music
that manages to be unbelievably re-listenable. I’ll never get sick of this
record. [<em>Memory</em>: This was an amazing time for musical discovery. The tools
at my disposal to hear new things and rise of indie created a unique situation
I will never see again. Every couple weeks I was discovering a new favorite
band like this that already had a half a dozen or so great albums.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Copia</em> by <strong>Eluvium</strong> - It is hard to make ambient music that really stands
out. This is gorgeous, and wholely unique. There isn’t anything else out there
with this same kind of warm but vacant vibe. The title of the track “Indoor
Swimming at the Space Station” really captures the scene well. [<em>Memory</em>: I
was really into the ambient works by Eno at the time and when I saw a modern
ambient record getting good press, I had to check it out.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Widow City</em> by <strong>The Fiery Furnaces</strong> - A number of indie pop acts had been
becoming increasingly weird over the last decade or so, and these guys started
out the weirdest of them all. This is a lot to digest. The funky keyboards,
the Zeppelin-esque hard rock guitar, Emily Freidberger’s off-kilter delivery
of her brothers weird poetry, all framed by mostly jaunty piano based pop
songs. Peak weird suited these guys best of all. [<em>Memory</em>: At the time, they
had been so productive it was easy to assume this would go on indefinitely.
Little did we know we would get only one more (fairly conservative) effort,
and the sibling band would go on permanent hiatus.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Good, The Bad, and the Queen</em> by <strong>The Good, The Bad, and the Queen</strong> -
The work of a unusual supergroup that ends up sounding more like the somber,
non-fiction continuation of its most famous member’s former band (Blur). A
brilliant meditation on the role of England in the 21st century. For almost 10
years, this was the most valuable record in my collection, and it deserved to
be so. It is a cult classic of the highest order, and one of my very
favorites. [<em>Memory</em>: In 2007 I took two trips to the UK for business. Both
times I was able to get up to London to do some tourist stuff. This album
became the soundtrack to the first trip and I streamed it repeatedly on my
trusty old iPod nano. On the second trip I saw a special performance of the
record in the moat of the Tower of London. What a memory I will cherish
forever!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>White Chalk</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - [<strong>2007 FAVORITE</strong>] What a left turn for
Polly Jean. The guitar is almost gone. The muscular vocals are no more,
replaced with her “church voice”. The aesthetic of this album is remarkable.
Barely proficient enough to make a piano based record, she finds incredible
songs in the simple arrangements. The creepy victorian attire she matched to
this music really completed the scene. Already an all-time great, this is
where it went to the next level. [<em>Memory</em>: I was already going to City Lights
every Tuesday to pick up the latest releases, but I particularly remember
rushing out as soon as the store opened that September to pick this one up.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cross</em> by <strong>Justice</strong> - While <strong>Daft Punk</strong> generally get all the attention
these guys made the foremost masterpiece of French Electronic music right
here. Everything is perfect, from the bombast of “Genesis”, through the pure
joy of “D.A.N.C.E.” to the wonderful crassness of <strong>Uffie’s</strong> rap on “The
Party”. This might be the best electronic dance music ever made. [<em>Memory</em>: I
used to like to play this during my runs at the time. I remember playing it
over the stereo system in the work gym one time and being really embarrassed
when <strong>Uffie</strong> started in on her rap, lol.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sound of Silver</em> by <strong>LCD Soundsystem</strong> - It can be hard to remember that
before EDM ruined things, electronic music was was of the most interesting and
fertile grounds for new musical ideas. They aren’t really doing anything new
here, but the combination of Krautrock grooves, disco beats, and New Wave
vocals was the perfect pallette for some great songs. “Someone Great” is a top
10 all-time track. [<em>Memory</em>: I was already sold on these guys from their
early singles and was right on this album when it was released. I remember
Greg at City lights being very lukewarm. I remember telling one of the trendy
interns at work about it, and how meh they were. It eventually became regarded
as an all time classic. I felt very ahead of the curve.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Night Falls over Kortedala</em> by <strong>Jens Lekman</strong> - This is a weird case. A
classic album, that the artist decided to replace with a completely new
version. I think I still like the original more, since it has a wonderful
quaintness that isn’t quite as strong on the new version. It is a guy trying
to make the symphonic <strong>Scott Walker</strong> records in his bedroom. The kind of
pure pop singing that only Scandinavians are allowed to do these days.
[<em>Memory</em>: This was the first year that I reviewed the top albums lists by the
major sites. This one was very high on the Pitchfork list and I gave it a
shot.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Memory Almost Full</em> by <strong>Paul McCarney</strong> - Paul clearly was becoming aware of
the peaking indie rock scene, and it shows. One of his strongest later year
efforts, especially the power pop of “Only Mamma Knows” and the eccentric
vocoder and harpsichord experimental pop of “Feet in the Clouds”. [<em>Memory</em>:
I remember listening to this on my Sansa as I waited for my plane from
Heathrow to Dublin, drinking a Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout right at the gate.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Obligatory Villagers</em> by <strong>Nellie McKay</strong> - It is weird that her best album
is almost impossible to hear these days, and I’m glad to have the physical CD
(I assume there are rights issues). The perfect combination of comical
commentary and top notch songwriting. This time with an amazing collection of
jazz musicians to give everything a dramatic cabaret feel. [<em>Memory</em>: Soon
after this album, she did a video with NPR music that documented her
songwriting process, which was quite remarkable.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Friend and Foe</em> by <strong>Menomena</strong> - The first shot fired in the “floor tom
band” scene. This highly percussive brand of melodic indie rock was super
novel at time, but would be cliche less than a year later. Still a solid
record, but it is hard to hear it the same way after all the soundalikes. The
sax does add a little something extra that makes this hold up a bit better
than the rest. [<em>Memory</em>: These guys hold the unique distinction of being a
band I have seen live, but do not really remember having seen. I saw them in
Philly in 2010, and remember it as being a good show, but nothing else really.
At least I have the shirt to prove I was there.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Challengers</em> by <strong>The New Pornographers</strong> - An outstanding record that both
shows what a great pop band they are together, but the strengths that the
three primary songwriters have as individuals. Also some great vocals from new
member Kathryn Calder, especially “Adventures in Solitude”. “My Rights Versus
Yours” is one of the greatest opening tracks ever. The way it slowly builds to
introduce the sounds of the record is first rate album sequencing. [<em>Memory</em>:
At first I wasn’t so sure about the mellower mood of this record, but I now
appreciate this as one of their finest efforts.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Boxer</em> by <strong>The National</strong> - The pivot album between the more punk influenced
sounds of the first few records, and the mid-tempo alt-rock that would come.
First rate musicianship throughout, and Matt Berninger’s voice is as rich and
textured as it would ever be. “Mistaken for Strangers” is the finest product
of their early phase. [<em>Memory</em>: I was so resistant to these guys, and refused
to engage with this record when it was new. All of a sudden when I hit my 30s,
I liked few bands more.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hissing Fauna, You Are the Destroyer</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong> - The album where
his bedroom psych pop went dance. It wasn’t as big of a tweak as it sounded at
the time, but it was apparently the move that made the world appreciate the
talent that had always been there. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember playing this CD in my
office after a visit to City Lights Records on new music Tuesday. The uptempo
dance groove was a bit shocking to me as a long time fan, but I was on board
for the new sounds from the start. I was shocked that the general public was
too. It was a unique time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Stage Names</em> by <strong>Okkervil River</strong> - This was a straightforward indie
rock pallette cleanser in one of the most experimental eras. The definition of
NPR music, it is quaint but not bland, and often quite pretty. “Savannah
Smiles” is a particular highlight. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw these guys in Rochester on
the next album cycle. It was clear from the setlist that they recognized this
as their best work.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em> by <strong>Spoon</strong> - Indie rock was peaking and new buzz bands were
emerging every week. Some of the American indie acts that had been at it since
the late 90s were raising to prominence in a whole new way. This was the
record where Austin’s biggest secret used their heightened influence to make a
very big, Motown tinged record. It was their highest point. [<em>Memory</em>: There
are two times in my life I had to pull over my car because I heard a new song
that was too good for me to concentrate. “You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb” was one of
them.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Marry Me</em> by <strong>St. Vincent</strong> - Far smaller, but no less complex, the contrast
is stunning with where the artist is now. I miss the sound of this record (and
the one that came later). Somehow she has gotten way noisier and flashier, yet
way more boring. These ornate, but subtle home recordings are some of the
finest songs in indie-pop history. I try to not be one of those people who
complain about artists selling out for mainstream fame, but I can’t see
anything else here. [<em>Memory</em>: I downloaded this record from eMusic based
purely on their review. I got so much great music off of that site.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In Our Bedroom After the War</em> by <strong>Stars</strong> - I know the record before this is
supposed to be the classic (and it is a perfectly fine indie pop record) but
this will always be my favorite. Such sweet little songs with strong
melodies and warm vocals. Every now and then they show glimpses of something
more than pop, like the jazz influenced “My Favorite Book”. [<em>Memory</em>: One of
those records I listened to on repeat on my Sansa MP3 player during lunchtime
walks at work around the East College Ave area.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Random Spirit Lover</em> by <strong>Sunset Rubdown</strong> - A wonderfully strange record.
Low budget indie-prog made by an artist who had won fame making straight ahead
indie rock with his other band <strong>Wolf Parade</strong>. I assume that connection was
the only reason the general music press even cared about this, but I’m glad it
was brought to my attention. You get the impression that the musicians being
stretched way beyond their ability, but what they produced ended up amazing
anyway. “Stallion” is so over the top and outrageously good. [<em>Memory</em>: When I
started buying Vinyl LPs, this was one of the first things I sought out. This
is meant for physical media.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>All Hour Cymbals</em> by <strong>Yeasayer</strong> - <strong>Menomena</strong> were first, but this was the
record that broke the sound. One of those discs that would spawn a million
imitators, this kind of percussive, dance-able indie-pop would be pervasive
over the next half decade. While this band would soon move on to other
things, they leave behind one of the finest and most interesting entries in
the sub-genre. [<em>Memory</em>: I distinctly remember listening to this for the
first time waiting for an early AM flight at the State College, PA airport.]</p></li>

<h2>2008<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I look at my favorites I am struck by two things. First, almost the entire
list is comprised of fairly new (at the time) indie acts, with only two “legacy”
artists in <strong>Portishead</strong> and <strong>Steven Wilson</strong> (who was himself a newly minted
solo artist after the end of <strong>Porcupine Tree</strong>). The second thing I notice is
how almost all of these were discovered as they came out and represent what I
was actually listening to in 2008. Only the <strong>Metronomy</strong> and <strong>William
Brittelle</strong> records were retrospective discoveries, and only by a year or two
each. It almost seems like this is the most aligned I would be with what was hot
and “now”. This year also has the distinction of being the year that I bought a
turntable and started buying vinyl records (in November). It was here that I
started the practice of buying my favorites on vinyl. Without streaming, new
discoveries were often still made on CD, so I own no less than 11 of the albums
below on both vinyl and CD. If it wasn’t on eMusic, I was often getting new
music on the small discs and making the upgrade when something became a
favorite.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2008.jpg"><img alt="My 2008 favorite albums" src="../_images/2008.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Devotion</em> by <strong>Beach House</strong> - The second (and final) record in their
original sound before moving to far bigger and more popular sonic territory. I
do prefer what they would become, but there is a lot to love on these much
smaller, and more acoustic early songs. They would keep going upwards from
here, but they were always great. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw them on this album cycle
playing a twin headline show with <strong>The Walkmen</strong> at the TLA in Philadelphia.
I had a nice chat with Vicky Legrand at the merch booth and shared the memory
of their issues at their first London show in 2007. She smiled and almost
yelled: “You saw the worst show ever!” I bought of copy the “Used to Be”
single as a 45 and when I got home from the 3 hour drive, I listened to the
sound of what was to come.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>William Brittelle</em> by <strong>Mohair Timewarp</strong> - My point of entry would be his
concept 2010 concept album, but I would circle back to this weird art rock
record not long after. A very strange album with extremely strange lyrics. I
really wish New Amsterdam was releasing music like this. [<em>Memory</em>: This
might end up being the last CD I ever buy. I realized it was one of the few
albums I didn’t own in any format and it wasn’t streaming. So I bought a CD
copy in early 2022.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Half Hours with the Lower Creatures</em> by <strong>Rachel Taylor Brown</strong> - I’m fairly
certain 99% of the folks who know about this artist, were introduced via the
appearance of “Stagg Field” on NPR’s “All Songs Considered”. I’m not a huge
fan of the show, but I really have to credit those guys for shining a light on
some very non-commercial music by an obscure artist who would otherwise get no
attention. A terrific art rock album. [<em>Memory</em>: After hearing this amazing
record and the follow up in 2009 that I liked even more, I ordered her entire
back catalog from CD Baby. The rest wasn’t that great.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In Ghost Colours</em> by <strong>Cut Copy</strong> - There were a bunch of bands that were
making music that referenced an imaginary version of the 80s that never really
existed, and then there were these guys. This is a wonderful modernization of
<strong>New Order</strong> or <strong>OMD</strong> for the home recording era. [<em>Memory</em>: I totally held
a vinyl copy of this in my hand at the Pitchfork music festival in 2009. I
didn’t realize how few of them they made, and that it would never get a
re-issue. This kind of thing would go out of style, and I assume it will never
be repressed.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Missiles</em> by <strong>The Dears</strong> - Another great Canadian husband/wife band (why
are there so many of these?). If <strong>The Arcade Fire</strong> are too subtle for you,
you can count on these guys. Super over the top, dramatic rock that manages to
be both kinda stupid and very beautiful. [<em>Memory</em>: Around this time I was
listening to the XM Canadian indie channel called “The Verge” where I
discovered this band and many other favorites.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Offend Maggie</em> by <strong>Deerhoof</strong> - Simultaneously one of the heavier and
quieter albums by one of the most unique acts to come out of millennial indie.
[<em>Memory</em>: I regretted buying this on vinyl at the time, which feels odd to me
now. It also happens to be one of the more valuable albums I own now.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Microcastle</em> by <strong>Deerhunter</strong> - This is where the formula came together. All
the great psychedelic atmospherics were still there, but now we had moments of
supreme pop songwriting spread throughout. [<em>Memory</em>: I was always very
skeptical of Pitchfork, but man they were right to champion this amazing
record.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In Ear Park</em> by <strong>Department of Eagles</strong> - One of those records I like way
more than almost everyone else. I still like this slightly more than any of
the albums by Dan Rosen’s main band, <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong>. I’ve always been a
sucker for this kind of fuzzy, layered production, and the spare piano based
arrangements really work for this kind of music. [<em>Memory</em>: For some reason
this became a favorite album to listen to while I ran around this time.
Totally inappropriate to task, this was the soundtrack to many laps around the
Penn State IM building track.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Barbarians Move In</em> by <strong>Duels</strong> - A massive change-up after the UK Indie
pop of the first record. A moody post-punk record, with moments of orchestral
rock pomp. The title song is a striking, dirge-like record that makes me
wonder what happened to these guys between releases [<em>Memory</em>: I didn’t
realize until the end of the year that this had come out. There were a few
reviews on Amazon where folks were calling this a lost classic. They were right.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>4</em> by <strong>Dungen</strong> - A return to the softer, more melodic side of things.
Doesn’t feature the flute like what came before and after, but still gorgeous
stuff. [<em>Melody</em>: This was around the time the English language imitators
<strong>Tame Impala</strong> appeared. It really bummed me out that this album was
overshadowed by second class copycats.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Seldom Seen Kid</em> by <strong>Elbow</strong> - The biggest band to come out of 2000s UK
Indie. They came up with a sound that combined the best points of <strong>Blur</strong>
style Britpop and classic <strong>Peter Gabriel</strong> style Art Rock. This was the album
after which they became too big to be Indie any longer. [<em>Memory</em>: When this
album first was getting press, I dismissed it as the next <strong>Coldplay</strong> but I’m
glad they proved me wrong.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sleep Well</em> by <strong>Electric President</strong> - This was the last record that I really
enjoyed from the minimalist electro-indie pop that was big in the first decade
of the millennium. Some really great shoegazey post-rocky guitar in this one
that added a new texture to their sound. A very mellow record with a calm vibe
that I really enjoy. [<em>Memory</em>: This reminds me of the walks that I would take
during lunch break from work, listening to my latest music acquisitions on my
old school Sansa 200 MP3 player. This was a nice calm record to put on in the
middle of stressful day at a startup company.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Midnight Organ Fight</em> by <strong>Frightened Rabbit</strong> - The most Scottish of the
Scottish bands. Such a wonderful folk-punk band with enough UK Indie bombast
to make a big sound without going over the top. They would never match this
again, but most bands never make one almost this amazing. [<em>Memory</em>: I liked
this record the first time I heard it, but I didn’t really connect with it
until a trip to LA in late 2008. This was a difficult trip for me, as I
realized I was growing apart from the group of friends I was traveling with. I
took the MetroLink train into the city solo to have a look around, and this
was the soundtrack to my visit.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Into Your Lungs…</em> by <strong>Hey Rosetta!</strong> - This year was probably the peak of
Canadian Indie and this was one of the most representative records of the
scene. So big (but unpretentious), so elegantly produced (but still quaintly
charming), a remarkable record. Americans can’t make music this kind of music
without sounding like cheeseballs. [<em>Memory</em>: This was another record that got
a ton of play on XM The Verge. Canadian Indie was where it was at in 2008.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Made in the Dark</em> by <strong>Hot Chip</strong> - The start of a more “serious” turn from
these guys. This still is slightly goofy dance-pop, but the humor was no
longer the focus. Still charmingly self-recorded, but the more straight ahead
themes makes for a more long lasting impact. [<em>Memory</em>: I forever get this
mixed up with the record that would come next (they are both great!) I even
included this record in the image for both years.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Feed the Animals</em> by <strong>Girl Talk</strong> - One of the last great outcomes of pop
music’s post modern era. It was also one of the most notable “pay what you
want” downloads in the post-MP3 era. His best attempt at merging the classic
rock and hip-hop eras. [<em>Memory</em>: Another running playlist regular for me.
Hard to hear this without thinking about turning laps at Tudek Park in State
College, PA.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Couples</em> by <strong>The Long Blondes</strong> - One of the most unjustifiably ignored
follow up records out there. Just as good as their much loved debut, this
record probably mostly suffered from a lack of promotion and tour support. My
favorite band from the pop side of the post punk revival, this band blows away
<strong>The Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs</strong> in my opinion. It is very sad this would be the end.
[<em>Memory</em>: I was amazed to buy an unopened back-stock original pressing of
this in 2021, 13 years after release (on Amazon of all places!).]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Saturdays = Youth</em> by <strong>M83</strong> - Looking back, it almost seems like this
record is the genesis of the entire “imagined 80s” aesthetic that would
predominate a wide swath of the indie over the next 3-4 years. The chillwave,
the vaporwave, the other acts that seemed to be imitating a kind of 80s pop
music that never actually quite existed. Look at that cover, and its
characters from not quite a John Hughes film. It isn’t actually that different
from what this band had done in the record that preceded it, but it just found
a focus that anticipated what was to come. [<em>Memory</em>: It is hard to think of
this record without thinking of Hipster Runoff. Our boy Carles also understood
how important this sound would be to the future direction of indie.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rabbit Habits</em> by <strong>Man Man</strong> - This album feels like a straight up
modernization of the <strong>Captain Beefheart</strong> formula. It is a complete anomaly
in the indie scene of the day that works really well. [<em>Memory</em>: This is the
last show I would ever see at the State Theater in State College, PA. A great
venue that would bring a kind of indie show to the town for a short window in
the last years of the aughts. They didn’t have a liquor license at the time,
but had a great coffee shop. I was so hyped up on caffeine for the show, and
that was the right state for this music. The headliner was <strong>Cursive</strong>, who
were awful, and I left after one song.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Nights Out</em> by <strong>Metronomy</strong> - Unlike most people, I prefer the more poppy
records to come, but I like this as well. Much like <strong>Hot Chip</strong>, this band
knows exactly where to find the line between joke band and serious music.
[<em>Memory</em>: I was first attracted to this album by the amazing cover with the
painting of the guy proudly in front of the first generation Honda Insight.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Oracular Spectacular</em> by <strong>MGMT</strong> - No band or album exemplifies the
“mainstreaming of indie” more than what we have here. It deserved to be the
thing that broke indie to the general public. Fun but smart electronic pop
music, the kind of thing that appeals to teenagers and music collecting forty
year olds in equal measure. This is the least weird record this group is
likely to ever make, and likely the beginning and the end of any wide cultural
significance. [<em>Memory</em>: These guys have always been a major label act, but it
was the indie music fans who discovered them first. It was shocking to see a
band like this get such massive attention, but in retrospect the whole thing
felt calculated by Columbia. The birth of Mindie Rock.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>A Thousand Shark’s Teeth</em> by <strong>My Brightest Diamond</strong> - A transitionary
record between the guitar centered songs she started with, and the very fancy
chamber pop that was coming next. One of the greatest voices in indie, who
often doesn’t get enough credit for the range and quality of her songwriting.
I do miss the occasional heaviness she worked into the first two records.
[<em>Memory</em>: The first time I saw Shara live was at Bugjar in 2011, when she was
still in the guitar focussed configuration of this album cycle. It was quietist
I have ever seen an audience be while an artist performed at that venue.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Skeletal Lamping</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong> - My opinions of this record have
evolved significantly over time: starting at disappointing mess, to flawed but
partially listenable, and today as possibly the best record by one of my
favorite acts from these days. This collection of micro-songs really needs to
be listened to all at once. It is also best not to spend too much time
thinking about the often cringeworthy lyrics, and instead focus on how
interesting it all sounds. [<em>Memory</em>: When this came out, I really thought
that fame had gone to Kevin Barnes head, and ruined him. It turns out fame did
go to his head, and created something wonderfully over the top.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Third</em> by <strong>Portishead</strong> - [<strong>2008 Favorite</strong>] - It seems like this is going
to be the last album by this legendary band, and I’m happy with this being
their final and most important statement. There is no other album like this,
and it arrived as wholely unique in music history. This haunting,
uncomfortably minimalist electronic music only makes sense when listened to in
a dark room. The way they deconstruct their own signature sound on “Machine
Gun” is one of the most unique things a band has ever done. A top 5 favorite
of mine forever. [<em>Memory</em>: This album made it painfully clear to me how bad
the state of vinyl production was at the time. I bought three copies of it,
until I was able to assemble a single reasonable copy from discs extracted
from two different instances of the album.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rook</em> by <strong>Shearwater</strong> - Such a beautiful voice, and so much instrumental
talent in this band. That said, this is the only one of their records that
doesn’t bore me to tears. The significant use of the classic emo quiet/loud
dynamic is what does it for me I guess. [<em>Memory</em>: This was the vinyl album
that made me realize how good things could be when you got a good pressing.
For some reason, I was able to get this for like 5 bucks on Overstock.com. It
was an impulse buy that inspired me to buy my first proper Turntable. I can
remember clearly hearing the crisp, surface noise free sounds in my tiny
upstairs room in the Woodycest apartment I shared at the time. I had the
record on the Technics SL-1200 I still use, and probably will use for the rest
of my life.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>At War With Walls &amp; Mazes</em> by <strong>Son Lux</strong> - One of those acts that owes their
career and fame to NPR music. This nerdy electo-hip hop is the kind of thing
that is ready made for Public Radio. I prefer the proggy sounds that would
come later with the full band incarnation, but this early recording still has
much of the sounds that would be perfected in later work. [<em>Memory</em>: This
record holds the distinction of being the first I owned and discovered
exclusively on the vinyl format.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Soft Airplane</em> by <strong>Chad Vangaalen</strong> - The weirdest folk rock record I have
ever heard, and one of the best. The lyrics and music are both completely off
the wall. I don’t feel that he has ever reached these heights again as an
artist, and it seems like his best effort went into his production of other
artists from here on out. [<em>Memory</em>: Hearing the classic Casio drum machine
sounds on “TMNT Mask” really took me back to the old SK-1 days.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>You &amp; Me</em> by <strong>The Walkmen</strong> - By far my favorite band to come out of the
Post Punk revival, they would rapidly transcend that genre and make amazing
records like this. I love the warm textured sounds, and the over the top
belting. I saw these guys twice on this tour. If I could go back in time
to see any band, I would see the Walkmen at this point in their history.
[<em>Memory</em>: I remember sitting in my tiny Rochester apartment as December 2009
became January 2010 listening to the song “In the New Year”. I hatched a plan
to make a list of my favorite records from the closing decade. I never did
that properly, but it started the larger project this site represents.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Women</em> by <strong>Women</strong> - Angular, chaotic post-punk. They almost seem like the
only band to follow on from <strong>Wire’s</strong> late 70s trilogy. They even through in
a slick pop song in “Black Rice”. Stellar stuff, I wish they were able to make
more than the two albums they left us. [<em>Memory</em>: This album was a complete
impulse buy that I threw in on a vinyl order from the Simply Canadian website.
I was intimidated by it at first, but the format made me stick with it, and
I’m glad I did, wow!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Insurgentes</em> by <strong>Steven Wilson</strong> - Looking back now, his first solo record
was the biggest deviation from the <strong>Porcupine Tree</strong> sound. It is hard to put
a finger on exactly what is different, but this is clearly more a product of a
single person working alone. I think his music has been well served by the
changes, and alone his music has been more consistent than his band ever was.
“Significant Other” with its layered ethereal vocals and creepy toy piano is
probably still my favorite thing from his solo era. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember at
the time reflecting on how this was the last vestiges of my musical past, with
indie my clear future.]</p></li>

<h2>2009<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have been looking forward to this year. That is because in 2009 I spent
a lot of time documenting my favorites of the year, and therefore have a very
detailed understanding of my top records at the time of release. I even went so
far as to make a three disc compilation of my top tracks and distribute to my
friends. It was a throwback to my 1999 compilation (more on that later) and a
way to cap off what was a landmark year for my relationship with contemporary
pop music. That said, looking at the notes I distributed with the mix CDs, I
have to cringe a bit.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2009_mixes.jpg"><img alt="notes to my 2009 mix CDs" src="../_images/2009_mixes.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>I sound so young for a 29 year old, but I think my connection to pop music at
the time was making me feel young and I wanted to revel in it a bit. Admittedly,
I would never feel this connected to pop music again. Despite these somewhat
silly notes, I would actually get quite a few positive comments about the mix,
and even received three mixes in response! None of them were as carefully
curated and supplemented with footnotes, but it was nice to hear what other
folks were into at the time. I feel like I could spend a remarkable amount of
time analyzing how I feel now compared to what my impressions were at the time,
but for now I am going to keep this to a simple comparison of my top albums then
and now. Here are the albums that appear in my 2009 top 20 that I no longer
consider to be among my favorites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Mythomania</em> by <strong>Cryptacise</strong> - (#7) I was really feeling high on this band after
seeing them at Noise Pop 2009, but my interest really faded as I got away from
that show. In general that early 60s pop revival stuff hasn’t aged great for
me.</p></li>
<li><p><em>A Brief History of Love</em> by <strong>The Big Pink</strong> - (#8) Two killer singles “Dominos”
and especially “Velvet” made me greatly overate this at the time.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Eyes &amp; Eyes &amp; Eyes Ago</em> by <strong>Nesey Gallons</strong> - (#9) I really was into
Elephant 6 at the time, and wanted to like the latest artists in the
collective, even if they weren’t up to spec.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Up From Below</em> by <strong>Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros</strong> - (#12) I
didn’t like their “dirt hipster” image when I saw them live, mostly because of
my bad experiences with this demographic as as South Wedge resident. Listening
to this record again with fresh ears, I probably need to give it another
chance.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</em> by <strong>Phoenix</strong> - (#17) I used to love these guys,
but listening now I can’t understand why. Such generic dance indie.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Embryonic</em> by <strong>The Flaming Lips</strong> - (#18) Totally fine, like most of their
records. Doesn’t feel as interesting after others have done this kind of thing
much better.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Good Feeling Music of Dent May &amp; His Magnificent Ukulele</em> by <strong>Dent May</strong>
- (#20) I was responding to the amazing pop songcraft here, despite the
annoying ukulele packaging. With his later work, this is inessential. Wish he
had made a new version of the brilliant “College Town Boy” though.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As for my numbers 21-40, that feels like me stretching to make a list, though I
will comment on a couple that moved up to my favorites when they show up in my
current list.</p>
<p>This was the year I attended my first two music festivals, where I discovered
a ton of music. Also, in the fall I moved to Rochester, NY and had access to
much more live music and four fantastic record stores. It was at one of these,
Lakeshore Record Exchange, that I would buy many of the last CDs in my
collection. This is the last year that CDs will appear in significant number in
my photo of favorites. This was the most involved photo in this whole project to
create. I put a record in there by accident that isn’t among my favorites, can
you spot it? I’m certainly not going to go through the process of making it again!</p>

<li><p><em>Ashes Grammar</em> by <strong>A Sunny Day in Glasgow</strong> - While most of the bands were
trying to conjure up the sprit of the 80s, these guys were making the kind of
electronic, vaguely world music sounds that are straight out of the mid-90s. A
strange little art rock record that it is really hard to compare to anything.
It manages to be densely complex, and charmingly amateurish at the same time.
[Memory: I discovered this while perusing the Pitchfork best of 2009 list.
This really was the best era for that website actually promoting good music.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Abnormally Attracted to Sin</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - I wasn’t paying very close attention to
Tori’s career when this came out, and didn’t really listen to it closely until
almost a decade later. This is as wild record, where she seems to be trying
out some of the popular music trends that had transpired during her 20-odd
years in the industry. “Police Me” is particularly out there sound for Tori,
and I’m not sure how to describe what it even is. 2007-2009 was the most
experimental and diverse time in her career. it doesn’t all work, but it will
never stop being interesting. [<em>Memory</em>: This was one of the very last CDs I
ever purchased at a Best Buy.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Merriweather Post Pavilion</em> by <strong>Animal Collective</strong> - This is one of those
records that was absolutely huge at the time, but you rarely hear about now.
It still really holds up pretty well. Kind of a low-fi, electronic <em>Pet
Sounds</em>, I rarely listen to it anymore, but always enjoy when I do. [<em>Memory</em>:
This was one of the first albums I bought in 2009, and one of the first new
releases I purchased on vinyl. I tried to buy it from Greg at City Lights, but
he refused to switch back to vinyl. Probably why his store is no longer with
us.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hospice</em> by <strong>The Antlers</strong> - As my mix-notes indicate above, this was my
album of the year at the time. That isn’t true anymore, but I still think this
is a beautiful and haunted set of songs that I’m alway happy hear. However,
the sullen mood and subject matter is something that I’m generally no seeking
out. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw them play almost the entire album in sequence at
Pitchfork Music Festival in 2009, and that powerful performance was one of the
best I have ever seen]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Humbug</em> by <strong>Arctic Monkeys</strong> - I had enjoyed their first two records, but
for some reason this is where it started to really click for me. They are
mining the goth sounds that I love here a bit. It is also the album where the
pop song-craft really started to take form. “Crying Lightning” is a remarkable
pop-rock song. [<em>Memory</em>: When I moved to rochester my record collection had
started to grow significantly. I remember constructing new record crates to
store them, sitting on the old green carpet in the entry hall of my tiny attic
apartment.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Best Rest Forth Mouth</em> by <strong>Bear in Heaven</strong> - Ah, the era of the percussive
electronic music. These guys were the best at it, and they didn’t even need
a floor tom guy to make it work. It was refreshing to see bands that were
working in a synthpop adjacent space, who had no interest in digging up the
80s. [<em>Memory</em>: The lead singer of this band had a great ironic mustache,
which was the style of the time. Shortly their after, Movember, was developed
as an excuse for men to grow mustaches again. I would grow a pretty sweet one
of my own.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>March of the Zapotec/Holland</em> by <strong>Beirut</strong> - This collection of two EPs, is
highly successful in two very different genres. The first, is the typical
world music, chamber pop this guy is generally making, but with a huge brass
band. The second is delightful, early 90s techno. The combination works great
together somehow. [<em>Memory</em>: These guys embody the 2000s more than anyone. I
had to pick a performance by them from Pitchfork 2009 for the banner on this page.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Susan Storm’s Ugly Sister and Other Saints and Superheroes</em> by <strong>Rachel
Taylor Brown</strong> - Such a cool concept for an album that is done mostly really
well. Less famous (mostly imaginary, and quite troubled) comic book
characters, and religious myths (The original superheroes). [<em>Memory</em>: I don’t
know if this is true or not, but I remember this CD as the first thing I ever
ordered online and had delivered to my new home of Rochester.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Hazards of Love</em> by <strong>The Decemberists</strong> - This band had been heading
down a road of fairy tales and prog rock that peaked with with release. Some
great vocal contributions from Shara Nova of <strong>My Brightest Diamond</strong>. I wish
it was a little shorter, and would probably come back to it more if it had
been trimmed down a bit. [<em>Memory</em>: There was an amazing full performance
video of this on YouTube back in the day, I really wish that was still
available.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bitte Orca</em> by <strong>Dirty Projectors</strong> - I don’t know that a band has ever done
more with less technical proficiency (outside of punk music anyway). I don’t
think this record is as intentionally arty as the reviews would have you
believe. This is a band stretching their skills way beyond the advisable. So
charmingly amateurish, and somehow it adds up to way more than its individual
parts. Everyone in this band had a completely untrained voice, and it all
works.[<em>Memory</em>: I was very resistent to this record at first given how rough
around the edges it is, and how much Pitchfork was pushing it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Duckworth Lewis Method</em> by <strong>The Duckworth Lewis Method</strong> - A very late
addition that I discovered more than a decade after release. Amazing in the
way <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> always is, but with a sense of whimsey that could
only be produced by a concept album about the sport of cricket. I don’t
understand all the references here, but the examination of Britain’s falling
stature in the game, as an analogy for larger world issues is hard to miss.
[<em>Memory</em>: I listened to this album more than any other in the year of 2021,
and it even inspired me to research, and learn the rules and strategy of
cricket so I could understand it better.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tarot Sport</em> by <strong>Fuck Buttons</strong> - I think they tried to come up with a new
genre name for this kind of thing, but looking back it just fits on the
electronic branch of the post rock tree. Such positive high energy music, I
used to put this on the end of running playlists to get me home from long
runs. [<em>Memory</em>: This is the first new release that I really had to extend
effort to get on vinyl. I imported a copy from Amazon UK.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Con Law</em> by <strong>Generationals</strong> - Remembering back to this era I think of two
things: Chillwave, and this kind of straightforward, dance-able pop music.
This first record has a rawness to it that would be sanded off in their later,
more big-budget releases. They work better in this lower fidelity format.
[<em>Memory</em>: One of the many great bands I saw play to a mostly empty room at
Bugjar. Those who were there had a great time bopping around to these guys.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Album</em> by <strong>Girls</strong> - One of my favorite bands of all time, and I pretty much
love everything they did in their short career. My favorite will always be
this collection of stunning pop songs. “Hellhole Ratrace” is a remarkable
story of refusing to give up, and learning to go it alone when there is no one
else to lean on. [<em>Memory</em>: I’m so glad I was able to catch these guys at
Pitchfork 2010, as they would break up not long after.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Veckatimest</em> by <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong> - This was my point of entry for this band.
There first couple records didn’t connect with me, but there was something
about the more tightly constructed songs on this album that made me appreciate
their psych folk sound way more. I can’t think of a group with a more
distinctive sound, and every record since this one has had a very similar
feel, but I’m not anywhere close to being tired of it. [<em>Memory</em>: On one of my
first extended business trips to Rochester, I remember brining along my newly
purchased CD of this one. I remember for some reason I was assigned a full
size pickup as my rental car. I also remember how amazing “Two Weeks” sounded
the first time I heard it while pulling into the East Henrietta Country Inn
and Suites.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Here We Go Magic</em> by <strong>Here We Go Magic</strong> - If you were to strip <strong>Grizzly
Bear</strong> back to the bare essentials, you would have something like this record.
The next album, by the full band version of this act would blow this away, but
there is some real magic in songs like “Fangela”. [<em>Memory</em>: When I saw this
band in 2010 I bought a shirt with the cover of this album on it. It had a
hold in the sleeve, and I never wore it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Seek Magic</em> by <strong>Memory Tapes</strong> - This guy always hated being lumped in with
the Chillwave bands. I can kind of understand why, as this is built from
mostly very different parts. That said, the highly melodic and psychedelic
sounds on offer here invoke the same sort of painful nostalgia for a 1980s
that never existed. “Plain Material” is one of my all time favorite songs, and
it is hard to hear it without seeing a crowd of wayfarer wearing hipsters
bopping around in Union Park, Chicago. [<em>Memory</em>: At Pitchfork 2009, this
record was for sale at the same amazing booth that had the Minimal Wave
compilations. I passed on it, and regretted it for almost a decade. I was
eventually able to get a vinyl reissue of this one.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fantasies</em> by <strong>Metric</strong> - The last great album by one of the great Canadian
indie bands, in the year that the Canadian renaissance started to wrap up. I
know they are still out there making music, but this is where it all starts
sounding the same to me. [<em>Memory</em>: This is one of the very first CDs that I
bought at Lakeshore Record Exchange, the alternative record store a two blocks
walk from my new apartment in Rochester, NY.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>No More Stories…</em> by <strong>Mew</strong> - [<strong>2009 FAVORITE</strong>] - Only Scandinavians can
make this kind of music. So warm and comfy, such catchy pop songs. This isn’t
chillwave, but it is making clear references to same imagined version of the
1980s. [<em>Memory</em>: I wish I knew how much I liked this band so I went to see
them at Pitchfork 2009 on the B stage.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wind’s Poem</em> by <strong>Mount Eerie</strong> - Such a heavy, beautiful record. I love how
it hides all those melodies in that sea of noise. Needs to be listened to at
high volume full the full impact. [<em>Memory</em>: I didn’t full appreciate this
record until I listened to it on a night drive at high volume, from beginning
to end. The way this should be experienced]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Life of the World to Come</em> by <strong>Mountain Goats</strong> - For some reason this
record separates itself from the dozens of others from this guy. It is the
same kind of self-produced indie folk/punk, but somehow by far my favorite.
[<em>Memory</em>: I liked this record going in, but I loved this record after seeing
a screening of a performance film of the whole record at Noise Pop 2010.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Resistance</em> by <strong>Muse</strong> - I always heard <strong>Queen</strong> when I listened to
these guys in a way that other folks did not seem to hear. Well after this
album I think I wasn’t the only one. Very over the top, and an exceptional
hard rock album. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw them on the tour for this record in Toronto
with some work friends.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Psychic Chasms</em> by <strong>Neon Indian</strong> - This is probably the definitive
Chillwave record and “Deadbeat Summer” the definitive song in the genre. It
also illustrates how the low budget production values were an essential part
of the formula. His later, more refined records just don’t hold up to this
fuzzy, messy masterpiece. [<em>Memory</em>: I don’t know that any record makes me
think of my tiny, dingy Park Avenue apartment than this one. I listened to
this a lot back in those days.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Pains of Being Pure atHeart</em> by <strong>The Pains of Being Pure at Heart</strong> -
There was a massive “Pitchfork backlash” against this one since the site
seemed to be way more into this than most. That said, they were absolutely
right, and this kind pop/rock is timeless. I think everyone expected some kind
of C86 revival, but this is really the only major artifact we got out of it.
[<em>Memory</em>: At the Pitchfork music festival in 2009 I had just heard <strong>The
Antlers</strong> play on the B stage and I was walking over to the main stages, and I
heard these guys playing “Stay Alive”. I spontaneously starting twirling
around in a circle as I walked. It was the last time I ever felt young.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>You Can Have What You Want</em> by <strong>Papercuts</strong> - A fuzzy kind of psychedelic
music that was compatible with, but not directly related to the prevailing
trends of the time. A great album throughout, but “The Machine WIll Tell Us
So” is one of my songs of the decade. This record almost fits better in 1999
than 2009 and it sounds timeless today. [<em>Memory</em>: I discovered this band
opening for <em>Camera Obscura</em> at the German House in the Rochester South Wedge.
I was nervous to walk through an unfamiliar neighborhood carrying my new copy
of their LP. I now own a house in that very neighborhood.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Real Estate</em> by <strong>Real Estate</strong> - Making this list it is clear how this was
the peak of fuzzy psychedelic music. These guys are making really pleasant
jangly pop, with the fuzz dial turned up to 11. [<em>Memory</em>: I didn’t get into
this band until I saw them at a Pitchfork after-show in 2011. I was there to
see Dent May, but these guys were super impressive live.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Junior</em> by <strong>Röyksopp</strong> - It was tough to pick a favorite for this year, as I
was split between the one I picked and this stellar record. Interestingly, I
didn’t even put this on my list of favorite albums I made at the time! I was
already into this band by 2009, and their ambient classic <em>Melody AM</em> was a favorite.
This album was a shock, as they had transformed into some sort of Scandinavian
<strong>Daft Punk</strong>. This is stunning electro-pop record, and I wish we had gotten
more like it. [<em>Memory</em>: I held a vinyl copy of this in my hands once. I
didn’t understand how great it was then. I greatly regret not buying it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Small Black EP</em> by <strong>Small Black</strong> - Another of the cornerstones of
Chillwave, this has a timeless sound that has aged really well. “Weird
Machines” is probably my favorite track from the whole genre. These guys did
survive the transition to more refined production values pretty well, but I
still prefer the fuzzy, heavily clipped sound of this record. You can’t keep
making this kind of music forever though. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw these guys at
BugJar some random weeknight and remember being disappointed by how bro-ish
these guys looked in their athleisure gear and ball caps.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Actor</em> by <strong>St. Vincent</strong> - A refinement of the sound from her first record,
and by far my favorite release by the artist. Eccentric bedroom pop with a
sharp rock edge, made without any notion of stardom or awareness of mass
popularity. Things would change after this record, in ways I did not care for.
[<em>Memory</em>: I saw her at Noise Pop 2009 (Great American Music Hall) right
before this came out. It was an outstanding show, and how I will always prefer
to remember the artist.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Suckers EP</em> by <strong>Suckers</strong> - I’m not exactly sure how to describe this genre,
but it falls in the same space as bands like <strong>Yeasayer</strong> or <strong>Menomena</strong>.
Highly percussive, with meandering instrumental passages, and serious music
that isn’t afraid to be very fun. They didn’t last long, but what they made
was great. [<em>Memory</em>: One of the last conversations I had with Greg at City
Lights Records (State College, PA) was about this record. He knew I was very
into <strong>MGMT</strong> and <strong>Menomena</strong> and he asked if I had heard the other band on
the big summer tour (these guys). He spun his CD-R of the EP for me.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The BQE</em> by <strong>Sufjan Stevens</strong> - Mark this down as one of those records I
like way more than almost anyone else. An amazing film soundtrack that borders
on Contemporary Classical, and Sufjan pushing his middle period sound to its
fullest extreme. This was also gave a preview of the electronic sounds that
were to come. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought this (with a wad of other releases) at
Lakeshore Record Exchange and listened to them repeatedly as I taught myself
how to wax my cross-country skiis in the basement lab at my work.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The XX</em> by <strong>The XX</strong> - A minimalist rock record that was wildly popular at
the time and that you hear little about today. My personal relationship has a
similar arc to it. One of my very favorites at the time, but something I
rarely find myself returning to today. Minimalism is tough. If what little is
there doesn’t have a lot of depth to it, it gets old quick. That said, I have
to include it, even if my time with it was brief but intense. [<em>Memory</em>:
Hipster Runoff loved to make fun of this record. Carles always had a good
understanding of what hype records were going to fade a bit over time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spirit Animal</em> by <strong>Zombi</strong> - It was strange to hear this kind of
instrumental prog rock in the 21st century. It not only exists, but is
excellent, especially the epic title track. [<em>Memory</em>: I discovered this
album when it was played before a <strong>Dungen</strong> show at Mohawk Place in Buffalo,
NY. I used the Shazaam music matching service to find it, and immediately
downloaded from eMusic. I was pleasantly surprized to see these guys play a
great opening set for <strong>Ghost</strong> half a decade later.]</p></li>
