<h2>2009<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have been looking forward to this year. That is because in 2009 I spent
a lot of time documenting my favorites of the year, and therefore have a very
detailed understanding of my top records at the time of release. I even went so
far as to make a three disc compilation of my top tracks and distribute to my
friends. It was a throwback to my 1999 compilation (more on that later) and a
way to cap off what was a landmark year for my relationship with contemporary
pop music. That said, looking at the notes I distributed with the mix CDs, I
have to cringe a bit.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2009_mixes.jpg"><img alt="notes to my 2009 mix CDs" src="../_images/2009_mixes.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>I sound so young for a 29 year old, but I think my connection to pop music at
the time was making me feel young and I wanted to revel in it a bit. Admittedly,
I would never feel this connected to pop music again. Despite these somewhat
silly notes, I would actually get quite a few positive comments about the mix,
and even received three mixes in response! None of them were as carefully
curated and supplemented with footnotes, but it was nice to hear what other
folks were into at the time. I feel like I could spend a remarkable amount of
time analyzing how I feel now compared to what my impressions were at the time,
but for now I am going to keep this to a simple comparison of my top albums then
and now. Here are the albums that appear in my 2009 top 20 that I no longer
consider to be among my favorites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Mythomania</em> by <strong>Cryptacise</strong> - (#7) I was really feeling high on this band after
seeing them at Noise Pop 2009, but my interest really faded as I got away from
that show. In general that early 60s pop revival stuff hasn’t aged great for
me.</p></li>
<li><p><em>A Brief History of Love</em> by <strong>The Big Pink</strong> - (#8) Two killer singles “Dominos”
and especially “Velvet” made me greatly overate this at the time.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Eyes &amp; Eyes &amp; Eyes Ago</em> by <strong>Nesey Gallons</strong> - (#9) I really was into
Elephant 6 at the time, and wanted to like the latest artists in the
collective, even if they weren’t up to spec.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Up From Below</em> by <strong>Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros</strong> - (#12) I
didn’t like their “dirt hipster” image when I saw them live, mostly because of
my bad experiences with this demographic as as South Wedge resident. Listening
to this record again with fresh ears, I probably need to give it another
chance.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</em> by <strong>Phoenix</strong> - (#17) I used to love these guys,
but listening now I can’t understand why. Such generic dance indie.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Embryonic</em> by <strong>The Flaming Lips</strong> - (#18) Totally fine, like most of their
records. Doesn’t feel as interesting after others have done this kind of thing
much better.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Good Feeling Music of Dent May &amp; His Magnificent Ukulele</em> by <strong>Dent May</strong>
- (#20) I was responding to the amazing pop songcraft here, despite the
annoying ukulele packaging. With his later work, this is inessential. Wish he
had made a new version of the brilliant “College Town Boy” though.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As for my numbers 21-40, that feels like me stretching to make a list, though I
will comment on a couple that moved up to my favorites when they show up in my
current list.</p>
<p>This was the year I attended my first two music festivals, where I discovered
a ton of music. Also, in the fall I moved to Rochester, NY and had access to
much more live music and four fantastic record stores. It was at one of these,
Lakeshore Record Exchange, that I would buy many of the last CDs in my
collection. This is the last year that CDs will appear in significant number in
my photo of favorites.</p>

<li><p><em>Ashes Grammar</em> by <strong>A Sunny Day in Glasgow</strong> - While most of the bands were
trying to conjure up the sprit of the 80s, these guys were making the kind of
electronic, vaguely world music sounds that are straight out of the mid-90s. A
strange little art rock record that it is really hard to compare to anything.
It manages to be densely complex, and charmingly amateurish at the same time.
[Memory: I discovered this while perusing the Pitchfork best of 2009 list.
This really was the best era for that website actually promoting good music.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Abnormally Attracted to Sin</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - I wasn’t paying very close attention to
Tori’s career when this came out, and didn’t really listen to it closely until
almost a decade later. This is as wild record, where she seems to be trying
out some of the popular music trends that had transpired during her 20-odd
years in the industry. “Police Me” is particularly out there sound for Tori,
and I’m not sure how to describe what it even is. 2007-2009 was the most
experimental and diverse time in her career. it doesn’t all work, but it will
never stop being interesting. [<em>Memory</em>: This was one of the very last CDs I
ever purchased at a Best Buy.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Merriweather Post Pavilion</em> by <strong>Animal Collective</strong> - This is one of those
records that was absolutely huge at the time, but you rarely hear about now.
It still really holds up pretty well. Kind of a low-fi, electronic <em>Pet
Sounds</em>, I rarely listen to it anymore, but always enjoy when I do. [<em>Memory</em>:
This was one of the first albums I bought in 2009, and one of the first new
releases I purchased on vinyl. I tried to buy it from Greg at City Lights, but
he refused to switch back to vinyl. Probably why his store is no longer with
us.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hospice</em> by <strong>The Antlers</strong> - As my mix-notes indicate above, this was my
album of the year at the time. That isn’t true anymore, but I still think this
is a beautiful and haunted set of songs that I’m alway happy hear. However,
the sullen mood and subject matter is something that I’m generally no seeking
out. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw them play almost the entire album in sequence at
Pitchfork Music Festival in 2009, and that powerful performance was one of the
best I have ever seen]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Humbug</em> by <strong>Arctic Monkeys</strong> - I had enjoyed their first two records, but
for some reason this is where it started to really click for me. They are
mining the goth sounds that I love here a bit. It is also the album where the
pop song-craft really started to take form. “Crying Lightning” is a remarkable
pop-rock song. [<em>Memory</em>: When I moved to rochester my record collection had
started to grow significantly. I remember constructing new record crates to
store them, sitting on the old green carpet in the entry hall of my tiny attic
apartment.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Best Rest Forth Mouth</em> by <strong>Bear in Heaven</strong> - Ah, the era of the percussive
electronic music. These guys were the best at it, and they didn’t even need
a floor tom guy to make it work. It was refreshing to see bands that were
working in a synthpop adjacent space, who had no interest in digging up the
80s. [<em>Memory</em>: The lead singer of this band had a great ironic mustache,
which was the style of the time. Shortly their after, Movember, was developed
as an excuse for men to grow mustaches again. I would grow a pretty sweet one
of my own.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>March of the Zapotec/Holland</em> by <strong>Beirut</strong> - This collection of two EPs, is
highly successful in two very different genres. The first, is the typical
world music, chamber pop this guy is generally making, but with a huge brass
band. The second is delightful, early 90s techno. The combination works great
together somehow. [<em>Memory</em>: These guys embody the 2000s more than anyone. I
had to pick them for the banner on this page.]</p></li>
