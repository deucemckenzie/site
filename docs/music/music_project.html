<h1>The Life Music Project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-life-music-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For over ten years I have been slowly working on a personal project to create a
definitive list of my favorite pop music albums. Music has played a special role
in my life, and I want to create a canonical list of my favorites.
These pages will serve as the final document of this process.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/life_music_cover.jpg"><img alt="some of my records" src="../_images/life_music_cover.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>At the time of my
writing this introduction (12 Aug 2021), I have compiled a list of 994 albums
spanning the years of 1956 to the current day. I’m not sure how long this final
portion of the project will take, and it is very possible the list could expand
or morph significantly as I go.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 31 May 2025</strong></p>
<p>It has only been four months since I last updated this, but two big milestones
have happened. First, I was totally wrong about how long it would take to get to
90% of my favorites on vinyl. That happened in April of this year (1030 of 1141
favorites on vinyl as of this writing). Second, I have made the first big
reorganization of the site. The decade pages were becoming long and unruly, and
each year deserved its own page. Also, I was finding that some of my memories
were becoming incoherent,even to myself, so I added some additional footnote
context to help this site read a bit better. I did a word count and I have
written just about 100k words so far! That is about the size of a 400 page book.
This has turned into an extensive and immensely rewarding project, and I’m only
just a little over the halfway point. I’m really enjoying the process of writing
all this down, and I look forward to reading it again someday when this all
feels more nostalgic than some of it already has become.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 24 Jan 2025</strong></p>
<p>It has been about another year so time for an update. I’m not moving through
documenting the years as quickly as planned. My target of wrapping this by the
end of 2025 isn’t going to happen, and that is OK. This is definitely the kind
of thing that I should only work on when I feel excited to do it. When I am in
the mood for it, there are few things that I enjoy more in my free hours. I now
have covered the 30 year interval between 1994 and 2024. At this point I am
cataloging my favorites from the years of my childhood. Working backwards, I
will soon be in the years before my time as a music consumer, and beyond that,
the years before my existence as a living human.</p>
<p>As for the continued expansion of my vinyl collection, there was modest
progress. In preparation for the continued work here, I obtained what remained
from my 90s wishlist and was commonly available. I’m also working ahead a bit
evaluating records from the 1980s that I was considering adding to that list of
favorites. In addition to those threads of acquisition, there were another 7-8
favorites from each of the last two years, and the ongoing program of twenty
year anniversary releases that filled in some gaps in from the naughts. For the
first time I also made some significant revisions to the years already
cataloged, with a handful joining the list, and a handful leaving. At this point
I have recorded 1134 favorites, 1019 of which I own on my preferred format. This
puts me at 89.85%, right on the threshold of what I believe to be a kind of 90%
theoretical limit on this metric. Interestingly, acquiring only two favorites
already on my list would push me over the threshold, but it would take adding 16
new favorites on vinyl to the list to achieve it that way. While I am very
close, it could still take a few years to reach that number. Every new favorite
I add without the possibility for vinyl knocks me back a fair distance.</p>
<p>The biggest factor that makes me realize 90% isn’t happening any time soon is
the dwindling list of potential acquisitions [Correction: It actually took three
months after I wrote this to hit 90%]. I have been collecting vinyl records of
my favorite albums since I was in my mid-twenties (I feel lucky to have gotten
in when things were way cheaper). I have everything I want from before 1993. The
better part of two decades later, these are the last 18 I am looking for. I have
reached the point where they have never been available on the format, or are way
more expensive than I am willing to pay. I’ve been at this long enough to have a
sense of what is likely to get a reissue and I think I have a good shot at maybe
ten more of these in the years ahead.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/remaining_vinyl.jpg"><img alt="remaining vinyl I am looking for at a good price" src="../_images/remaining_vinyl.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p><strong>UPDATE 26 Jan 2024</strong></p>
<p>I have been trying to do a check-in about every year, and this one is a little
behind that schedule. That said, things continue to progress at a fairly decent
rate. In the almost 18 months since the last update, I have completed years
1997-2008 and continue my journey through the 90s. I have passed an interesting
milestone working backward through the years. I’m now finding that the large
majority of my favorite albums for a year were discovered well after release. It
won’t be long until I get to the point where I will have been too young to have
even been aware of the my favorites in their year of release. I have a new goal
of trying to finish this site before the year 2025, which would make the list
span an even 70 years at completion.</p>
<p>The work slowed down in early 2023 when I made another batch of purchases to
fill gaps in the vinyl collection of my favorites. That effort, plus a
surprising number of vinyl reissues has greatly reduced the percentage of
favorites that I do not own as an LP. As I type this, my list stands at 1103
albums, of which 973 I own on my preferred format. This is a ratio of 88%, and a
big increase over the last update on statistics. That said, the significant
progress has led me to a state where there aren’t many opportunities for
additional increases. Of the 130 I do not own on vinyl, I only care to add 26 in
that format. Eight of those albums have never been pressed as a record, or were
made in such a small volume that I am likely to never see a copy in the wild. Of
the remaining set, only five ever are sold for less than $100. I do expect to
continue to add new favorites, and occasionally add records already on the list,
but progress in this area will be slowing down significantly. This is a good
thing, because I really don’t have much room for more records. It does seem that
very slowly over time I may converge to 90%.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 7 Aug 2022:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been at this for one week short of a full year. In
that time I have cataloged the years 2009-2021 working backwards. I have decided
to keep a running list of my favorites from the current year as they happen. My
list of favorites has grown by 32 to a total of 1026. I am not quite a quarter
of the way through the process, and it this rate it will take another 3-4 years
to finish the catalog. Interestingly the year 2009 was around the time that I
started to think about doing something like this, though at that point the
project was much smaller in scope and related to my favorite albums of the
aughts. I look forward to taking on that project next.</p>
<p>This started as a project 98% for myself and it has probably
ended up being more than 99% something that no one else would ever care about.
The more personal it has become, the more I have enjoyed it. At some point when
I got far enough back from the current day, I decided to add a personal memory
to each record. This is as much my musical autobiography as it is my catalog of
favorites.</p>
<p>Someday I will update the analytic section, but for now here are a few summary
statistics to capture things at this moment in time. I now own 826 of my
favorites on vinyl. There are exactly 200 records that are not in my vinyl
collection. Around 25 of these albums were never issued on vinyl, and over half
of them I do not want to acquire for a variety of reasons. That leaves 52
records that I would gladly add to my collection if I could find them at a
reasonable price. That said only five of these are currently selling at a price
I would be willing to give. At this point I’m almost leaving these titles as
something to look for when I visit a record store.</p>
<p>One of the goals of this project was to build a collection that properly
represented my tastes throughout life. Early in this project I realized that I was
converging towards owning 80% of my favorites on vinyl. I crossed that threshold
in July of 2022 with a special purchase. I imported a near mint copy of <strong>From
the Choirgirl Hotel</strong> from Italy. It was a semi-extravagance that put a close to
the era of significant vinyl acquisition. It now sits in a frame on my wall</p>

<h2>Why am I doing this?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-am-i-doing-this" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2011 the music streaming website Spotify was launched. It didn’t start off with
everything, but it did start with 90% of everything. All of a sudden those CDs
and MP3s I had been collecting and curating didn’t matter so much anymore. I
keep pretty detailed records on these kinds of things, and at the dawn of the
Spotify era I had a collection of 2035 albums in various formats. Roughly the
first 600 of those were acquired solely on compact disc in what we now call the
“physical media era.” I know the content of those 600 discs in a way that I will
never know music again. Yes this is partially because pop music is not just an art
form, but a cornerstone of youth culture. I was in my teens and early 20s in
those days and that is a factor. However, I do believe the most
significant factor was the way that I obtained and consumed that music. When you
pay significant money to get a physical item that you need to store and take
care of, you engage with it differently than a data file that you got for little
(or no) money. The rise of the MP3 changed my relationship with music forever.
Not only was a obtaining music more quickly, I was no longer limited by the
selection at the local record store. This made it much easier to try out new
things and discover music I may not have otherwise encountered. It also changed,
in somewhat negative ways, how I searched for new music. Before the MP3 it
almost required research and study to carefully expand upon the favorites you
currently knew and discover artists and albums that could become new favorites.
If the MP3 disrupted the way that I discovered and acquired new music, Spotify
destroyed it. At the time of my writing this, 98.8% of my favorite albums are
available to stream on the platform, and there are limitless options for what to
play next. In the streaming era it can become difficult to remember what music
I liked, or even listened to. I know exactly what I listened to when I was 15,
because it sits on shelves down in my basement. This project is an attempt to
create a universal model of “my music” through all eras.</p>

<h2>What do I hope to Learn?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-i-hope-to-learn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>What are my “personal, canonical favorites?”</em> - I want a consistent
understanding of what my favorite music is throughout the
various eras of music, and my various methods of music consumption.</p></li>
<li><p><em>What vinyl records do I really want?</em> - My interest in physical media has led me to compile my
“ultimate music collection” in the form of vinyl records. I like the idea of
generally bounding this collection to my true favorites.</p></li>
<li><p><em>When did I “get old?”</em> - Like most people, I have the strong feeling that at
some point in the last 10 years I lost touch with not only with popular music, but
also my connections to the youth culture it represents. When exactly did this
happen to me? (edit: I now know it was 2014)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Why is music so important to me?</em> - When I really got into the meat of this
project, it started to become clear that I was learning a lot about myself
through my relationship with this music. I look forward to this continuing in
the final phase of this project.</p></li>

<h2>What are the rules?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>No rankings</em> - I’m not interested in creating rankings or top tens. This is a
binary classification problem. Is an album one of my favorites (y/n)?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Things will change</em> - The initial list was crafted carefully and rigorously,
but I’m sure as I document things, there will be additions and possibly
removals. At a minimum, this will take a year or two to write down, and I will
have new favorites from the years that pass.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Only my arbitrary definition of pop music</em> - This isn’t all music only “pop”, no
classical for instance. This includes rock, rap, R&amp;B,
jazz, and electronic music. It even includes contemporary classical music that
is made with a a rock and roll spirit. So Philip Glass is in, Leonard
Bernstein is out. Except for West Side Story, because musicals are in.</p></li>
<li><p><em>I’m not reviewing I’m reflecting</em> - This is about what albums are my favorite
and why. I’m not qualified to write a review, or interested in doing so.</p></li>

<h2>Aren’t there already websites for this kind of thing?<a class="headerlink" href="#aren-t-there-already-websites-for-this-kind-of-thing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, there are music social networking sites (e.g. last.fm, RateYourMusic) that are
quite popular. I have experimented with them in the past, and have even started
this project in some form on them before. The truth is this is the kind of deeply
personal project where I want full control. Also, modern static site generators
have made it very easy to get high quality, flexible results from simple markdown
language text files. Right now I’m using Python/Sphinx/ReStructuredText to make what you are
currently seeing, but that could be quickly changed over to something else.
Also, I miss the early days of the web when you would sit down with a text editor
and craft a web publication by hand. Most of all, while my personal relationship
with music is very important to me, I don’t expect it to matter very much to
anyone else. So this project is 98% for myself, and I don’t care about the
social reach those other platforms might offer me. I’ll probably occasionally
post to my socials to let folks know I am working on this, but I assume there
will be little to no interest from others in what I put here.</p>

<p>Yes, I can’t help myself. More to come I’m sure, but for
now here is a chart of my favorite albums by year. It also shows how many of my
favorites from each year are in my curated vinyl collection. I currently own 76%
of my favorites on vinyl.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/album_chart_annotated.png"><img alt="Favorite albums by year" src="../_images/album_chart_annotated.png" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>Some observations from the data:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The peak of the first mode in the plot occurs in the year 1979. This makes
sense, because if you were to ask me what the best year in music was, this
would be my answer.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a period between about 1990 and 2009 where the percentage of my
favorites that I own on vinyl plummets. This is pretty much the “vinyl dark
ages” from the rise of the CD until the the vinyl revival started in earnest.
I would buy the records if they could be sourced for an affordable price.
This ratio will be greatly improved by the phenomena of the “20 year vinyl
reissue”.</p></li>
<li><p>The peak of the second mode, and the highest peak occurs in 2010. This year
was the culmination of the MP3 era, and I was writing for a local music blog,
hearing more music than I did at any other point in my life. It was also
before Spotify choice fatigue started to become a thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere in the middle of the 2010s I became “old” and set in my ways. But
when exactly did it happen, and why? (Edit: The answer is 2014, but the why
is still unclear).</p></li>
