<h1>The Life Music Project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-life-music-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For over ten years I have been slowly working on a personal project to create a
definitive list of my favorite pop music albums. Music has played a special role
in my life, and I want to create a canonical list of my favorites.
These pages will serve as the final document of this process.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/life_music_cover.jpg"><img alt="some of my records" src="../_images/life_music_cover.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>At the time of my
writing this introduction (12 Aug 2021), I have compiled a list of 994 albums
spanning the years of 1956 to the current day. I’m not sure how long this final
portion of the project will take, and it is very possible the list could expand
or morph significantly as I go.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 7 Aug 2022:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been at this for one week short of a full year. In
that time I have cataloged the years 2009-2021 working backwards. I have decided
to keep a running list of my favorites from the current year as they happen. My
list of favorites has grown by 32 to a total of 1026. I am not quite a quarter
of the way through the process, and it this rate it will take another 3-4 years
to finish the catalog. Interestingly the year 2009 was around the time that I
started to think about doing something like this, though at that point the
project was much smaller in scope and related to my favorite albums of the
aughts. I look forward to taking on that project next.</p>
<p>This started as a project 98% for myself and it has probably
ended up being more than 99% something that no one else would ever care about.
The more personal it has become, the more I have enjoyed it. At some point when
I got far enough back from the current day, I decided to add a personal memory
to each record. This is as much my musical autobiography as it is my catalog of
favorites.</p>
<p>Someday I will update the analytic section, but for now here are a few summary
statistics to capture things at this moment in time. I now own 826 of my
favorites on vinyl. There are exactly 200 records that are not in my vinyl
collection. Around 25 of these albums were never issued on vinyl, and over half
of them I do not want to acquire for a variety of reasons. That leaves 52
records that I would gladly add to my collection if I could find them at a
reasonable price. That said only five of these are currently selling at a price
I would be willing to give. At this point I’m almost leaving these titles as
something to look for when I visit a record store.</p>
<p>One of the goals of this project was to build a collection that properly
represented my tastes throughout life. Early in this project I realized that I was
converging towards owning 80% of my favorites on vinyl. I crossed that threshold
in July of 2022 with a special purchase. I imported a near mint copy of <strong>From
the Choirgirl Hotel</strong> from Italy. It was a semi-extravagance that put a close to
the era of significant vinyl acquisition. It now sits in a frame on my wall</p>

<section id="why-am-i-doing-this">
<h2>Why am I doing this?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-am-i-doing-this" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2011 the music streaming website Spotify was launched. It didn’t start off with
everything, but it did start with 90% of everything. All of a sudden those CDs
and MP3s I had been collecting and curating didn’t matter so much anymore. I
keep pretty detailed records on these kinds of things, and at the dawn of the
Spotify era I had a collection of 2035 albums in various formats. Roughly the
first 600 of those were acquired solely on compact disc in what we now call the
“physical media era.” I know the content of those 600 discs in a way that I will
never know music again. Yes this is partially because pop music is not just an art
form, but a cornerstone of youth culture. I was in my teens and early 20s in
those days and that is a factor. However, I do believe the most
significant factor was the way that I obtained and consumed that music. When you
pay significant money to get a physical item that you need to store and take
care of, you engage with it differently than a data file that you got for little
(or no) money. The rise of the MP3 changed my relationship with music forever.
Not only was a obtaining music more quickly, I was no longer limited by the
selection at the local record store. This made it much easier to try out new
things and discover music I may not have otherwise encountered. It also changed,
in somewhat negative ways, how I searched for new music. Before the MP3 it
almost required research and study to carefully expand upon the favorites you
currently knew and discover artists and albums that could become new favorites.
If the MP3 disrupted the way that I discovered and acquired new music, Spotify
destroyed it. At the time of my writing this, 98.8% of my favorite albums are
available to stream on the platform, and there are limitless options for what to
play next. In the streaming era it can become difficult to remember what music
I liked, or even listened to. I know exactly what I listened to when I was 15,
because it sits on shelves down in my basement. This project is an attempt to
create a universal model of “my music” through all eras.</p>

<section id="what-do-i-hope-to-learn">
<h2>What do I hope to Learn?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-i-hope-to-learn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>What are my “personal, canonical favorites?”</em> - I want a consistent
understanding of what my favorite music is throughout the
various eras of music, and my various methods of music consumption.</p></li>
<li><p><em>What vinyl records do I really want?</em> - My interest in physical media has led me to compile my
“ultimate music collection” in the form of vinyl records. I like the idea of
generally bounding this collection to my true favorites.</p></li>
<li><p><em>When did I “get old?”</em> - Like most people, I have the strong feeling that at
some point in the last 10 years I lost touch with not only with popular music, but
also my connections to the youth culture it represents. When exactly did this
happen to me? (edit: I now know it was 2014)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Why is music so important to me?</em> - When I really got into the meat of this
project, it started to become clear that I was learning a lot about myself
through my relationship with this music. I look forward to this continuing in
the final phase of this project.</p></li>

<section id="what-are-the-rules">
<h2>What are the rules?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>No rankings</em> - I’m not interested in creating rankings or top tens. This is a
binary classification problem. Is an album one of my favorites (y/n)?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Things will change</em> - The initial list was crafted carefully and rigorously,
but I’m sure as I document things, there will be additions and possibly
removals. At a minimum, this will take a year or two to write down, and I will
have new favorites from the years that pass.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Only my arbitrary definition of pop music</em> - This isn’t all music only “pop”, no
classical for instance. This includes rock, rap, R&amp;B,
jazz, and electronic music. It even includes contemporary classical music that
is made with a a rock and roll spirit. So Philip Glass is in, Leonard
Bernstein is out. Except for West Side Story, because musicals are in.</p></li>
<li><p><em>I’m not reviewing I’m reflecting</em> - This is about what albums are my favorite
and why. I’m not qualified to write a review, or interested in doing so.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Aren’t there already websites for this kind of thing?<a class="headerlink" href="#aren-t-there-already-websites-for-this-kind-of-thing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, there are music social networking sites (e.g. last.fm, RateYourMusic) that are
quite popular. I have experimented with them in the past, and have even started
this project in some form on them before. The truth is this is the kind of deeply
personal project where I want full control. Also, modern static site generators
have made it very easy to get high quality, flexible results from simple markdown
language text files. Right now I’m using Python/Sphinx/ReStructuredText to make what you are
currently seeing, but that could be quickly changed over to something else.
Also, I miss the early days of the web when you would sit down with a text editor
and craft a web publication by hand. Most of all, while my personal relationship
with music is very important to me, I don’t expect it to matter very much to
anyone else. So this project is 98% for myself, and I don’t care about the
social reach those other platforms might offer me. I’ll probably occasionally
post to my socials to let folks know I am working on this, but I assume there
will be little to no interest from others in what I put here.</p>

<p>Yes, I can’t help myself. More to come I’m sure, but for
now here is a chart of my favorite albums by year. It also shows how many of my
favorites from each year are in my curated vinyl collection. I currently own 76%
of my favorites on vinyl.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/album_chart_annotated.png"><img alt="Favorite albums by year" src="../_images/album_chart_annotated.png" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>Some observations from the data:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The peak of the first mode in the plot occurs in the year 1979. This makes
sense, because if you were to ask me what the best year in music was, this
would be my answer.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a period between about 1990 and 2009 where the percentage of my
favorites that I own on vinyl plummets. This is pretty much the “vinyl dark
ages” from the rise of the CD until the the vinyl revival started in earnest.
I would buy the records if they could be sourced for an affordable price.
This ratio will be greatly improved by the phenomena of the “20 year vinyl
reissue”.</p></li>
<li><p>The peak of the second mode, and the highest peak occurs in 2010. This year
was the culmination of the MP3 era, and I was writing for a local music blog,
hearing more music than I did at any other point in my life. It was also
before Spotify choice fatigue started to become a thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere in the middle of the 2010s I became “old” and set in my ways. But
when exactly did it happen, and why? (Edit: The answer is 2014, but the why
is still unclear).</p></li>
