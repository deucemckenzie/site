<h1>1989 Albums<a class="headerlink" href="#albums" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When I think about this year, I remember the sense of reflection that seemed to
dominate everything in the pop music world. Everyone was doing countdown lists
of the most important songs/albums of the decade, and it seemed like an
important cultural effort to curate a list of the most significant music from
the closing decade. It wouldn’t take long for the first “80s music” compilations
to appear on the discount store racks, and for some reason this was a decade
that triggered nearly instantaneous nostalgia. By this time, there was already
quite a bit of taxonomy and retrospective curation of the 60s and 70s pop/rock
cannon, and it felt like the world was getting a head start on the process for
the 80s.</p>
<p>When I look at my favorites for the year, I am a bit surprised that I clearly
remember hearing several of them at the time, with three of them (<strong>B-52s</strong>,
<strong>Billy Joel</strong>, <strong>Tom Petty</strong>) being among my favorites since their year of
release. I think this is probably because my brother and sister were both still
teenagers, and I was finding out about these records from their collections. It
is quite a mixed bag of genres that is very much a product of late 80s pop
music, with a few indications of what was to come in the alternative rock
dominated early 90s.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/image_forthcoming.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1989" src="../_images/image_forthcoming.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Cosmic Thing</em> by <strong>The B-52s</strong> - Their first album without Ricky Wilson was a
big change in sound, but a massive success. Without Wilson’s distinctive
guitar work, we get a somewhat more conventional new wave record, that is
still miles away from what their contemporaries were doing. This will always
be most remembered for party rock classic “Love Shack”, which is deservedly
among the most famous rock songs of all time. My favorite tracks are ballad
“Deadbeat Club” and jangle pop classic “Roam”. In retrospect this feels like a
vague preview of music that would come in the early 90s. [<em>Memory</em>: I was very
into the singles from this record that I heard on MTV, and encouraged by
brother to buy a CD copy of the record. I had no awareness of the history of
this band, since it had been half a decade since their original era of
relevance. I remember one of my brother’s friends telling me that they had
been around for ages, but to a 9 year old, it felt like ancient history. It
would be a long time before I would connect with those early works.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Disintegration</em> by <strong>The Cure</strong> - The peak of their second phase, on this
release they perfected the combination of wistfully sweet pop songs, and moody
atmospherics. This is a collection of love ballads for goths. “Plainsong” is a
hard hitting and gorgeous way to to kick off the record. “Lovesong” is perhaps
their very finest pop song in an album that is loaded with great ones. I’ll
always like their darker, rockier early sound a bit more, but it is remarkable
how they mastered a wildly different, whole different kind of music.
[<em>Memory</em>: In the mid-90s my sister would pass down to me a bunch of items
including this CD, her CD boom-box, and a pair of walkman headphones. I would
put all three to immediate use listening to “Plainsong” at ill advised volume
to the point where those tiny headphone drivers started to break apart.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rhythm Nation 1814</em> by <strong>Janet Jackson</strong> - Sometimes music ends up sounding
dated in a way that makes it feel timeless. This album (and perhaps New Jack
Swing in general) is so aggressively of its time, it almost exists outside the
progressive development of contemporary R&amp;B. The robotic, synthetic rhythms
and swinging melodies are so late 80s it hurts. I almost can close my eyes and
picture an army of robots dancing in formation behind Janet, copying her
distinctive jazz moves. The story of this album is a jumbled, unintentionally
humorous mishmash of feel-good, but half formed, proto-social justice pleas.
What exactly is the nature and agenda of Rhythm Nation we are being invited to
join? I think the message was crafted with good intentions, if with poor
execution. The execution on the music however is perfect. “Miss You Much” is
the high point of the entire New Jack Swing movement. [<em>Memory</em>: I really
despised this at the time for some reason. It was on MTV constantly, and I
just wasn’t ready for it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Storm Front</em> by <strong>Billy Joel</strong> - Until the SiriusXM Billy Joel channel
existed, and we could hear the artist describe where his work was coming from,
I never released how much he was attempting to emulate the sounds of the other
artists of the day. With that information, it becomes easy to see the clear
lines connecting “That’s Not Her Style” and <strong>Robert Palmer</strong> or “Storm Front”
and <em>So</em> era <strong>Peter Gabriel</strong>. That said, it all ends up becoming uniquely
Billy. Some great little rock numbers, but the highlights are the quieter
story songs: “Leningrad”, “The Downeaster ‘Alexa”, and especially “And So It
Goes”. [<em>Memory</em>: I was watching MTV one September afternoon when they
announced a new video being added to the rotation. It was the lead single from
this album: “We Didn’t Start the Fire”. I was blown away by the possibility of
new music from an artist that had always been a big part of the lives of my
siblings and I. It felt like an eternity had passed since the last record, but
it had only been 3 years. Time works different when you are nine.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Like A Prayer</em> by <strong>Madonna</strong> - The absolute peak of her cultural influence
and in my opinion, her last five star classic. The master of 80s pop music
closes out the decade with another winner. The title song is a masterpiece
that I loved the first time I heard it, and I will never tire of. The other
singles like “Express Yourself” and “Cherish” also sit among her finest work,
but the quality of the album tracks aren’t nearly as high as what we got in
the early days of her career. [<em>Memory</em>: The video for “Like A Prayer” was on
MTV constantly at the end of the 80s. I never had this album when I was young,
and that song was one of the first things I downloaded from Napster back in
the day.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Pretty Hate Machine</em> by <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> - The most un-ambiguously
electro-industrial of his albums, and an extremely strong debut. I love the
cold, hard production style this one has and it really suits the nature of the
material. The one-two punch of “Head Like a Hole” and “Terrible Lie” are an
amazing start to what would be one of the most important artists of the next
decade. [<em>Memory</em>: I vividly remember hearing “Terrible Lie” at a house party
in the summer of 1999. I was blown away by the openly “blasphemous” lyrical
content, and cold, aggressive musical style. Not long after I would track down
a copy at the local Circuit City.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Full Moon Fever*</em> by <strong>Tom Petty</strong> - This was my favorite album in the year
of release, and held that title for many years to come. Listening to this with
adult ears, it is very easy to hear the strong influence of <strong>Jeff Lynne</strong> who
would get a kind of pop magic out of Petty that we would never quite see
again. I know it is trendy to be sick of “Free Fallin’”, but I will never tire
of this pop masterpiece. The singles have passed into legendary status, but it
is album tracks like “Feel a Whole Lot Better” and “Zombie Zoo” where this
album really distances itself from the rest of his catalog. [<em>Memory</em>: I was
pulled in by the brilliant “Alice in Wonderland” themed video for “Runnin’
Down A Dream” that was a fixture of MTV in the summer of ‘89. I remember my
brother accusing me of only liking it for the cartoon, but pretty quickly I
appreciated the quality of the song and the album.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Doolittle</em> by <strong>The Pixies</strong> - This is often spoken about as the definitive
album of early alternative/indie rock, and it is hard to argue against that.
The fundamental basis of this is punk, but it pulls from a far more eclectic
and adventurous collection of sounds. It also has a sense of whimsey and
experimentation that would typify the spirit of foundational indie rock.
Everything on this album is brilliant, but no song demonstrates their
brilliant artistic peak like the structurally adventurous track “Hey”.
[<em>Memory</em>: When I started at my first full-time job, one of the older
engineers noticed that listened to the indie rock of the day. He mentioned the
Pixies, and this album as his favorite. Soon after, I would get access to
eMusic, and this would be one of the first great albums I would hear for the
first time via that service.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Batman (Motion Picture Soundtrack)</em> by <strong>Prince</strong> - For me, this is the end
of his classic period, and the last essential album from beginning to end. It
isn’t as solid as the rest of his 80s output, but there is enough of those
Minneapolis sound grooves to keep the party going for one more full length.
The concept of the movie soundtrack also helps give this a kind of conceptual
unity and focus that much of his 90s work lacks. “Batdance” is a stunning time
capsule of 1989, and a testament to the artist’s ability to effortlessly
produce blistering, highly compelling guitar solos. “Trust” is one of the most
underrated Prince songs. [<em>Memory</em>: I loved the movie from the first time I
saw it, but I remember being put off by the seemingly incongruous Prince
soundtrack. I now see this music as an essential piece of a wholely unique
aesthetic created for the film.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Stone Roses</em> by <strong>The Stone Roses</strong> - The genesis of Britpop, especially
the psychedelic sub-set of the genre. They made exactly one good album, but it
is one of the greatest of all time. Often imitated by artists on both sides of
the Atlantic, but never quite equaled. It really doesn’t get enough credit for
also influencing the highly textured and sensitive indie rock bands that would
emerge in the 90s and 2000s. “Waterfall” is beautiful, and one of my favorite
songs. [<em>Memory</em>: One day we were waiting outside my middle school for the
doors to open for the first day of school, and a friend of mine was showing me
some CDs he had borrowed from his older brother. We were both very into <strong>The
Beatles</strong> and were excited by the latest “British Invasion”, including bands
like <strong>Oasis</strong> and <strong>Blur</strong>. I remember him telling me that this record was
where it all began. It would be years until I actually heard it, but he wasn’t
wrong.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Seeds of Love</em> by <strong>Tears for Fears</strong> - [<strong>1989 FAVORITE</strong>] - This album
was wasted on young me. I didn’t understand the understated, jazz influences.
The emotional vocals seemed cheesy and overdone. As an adult I totally get it,
and see it as one of the landmark achievements in progressive pop music, and
the finest work by this band. [<em>Memory</em>: I can’t think of an album that my
opinion has changed on more than this one. I remember my brother buying it at
release, and listening to it constantly. It took me decades to appreciate it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Oranges and Lemons</em> by <strong>XTC</strong> - The influences of 60s psychedelic rock were
there since the early 80s, but they come to the forefront here. This was the
end of any sort of commercial relevance for a band that always flew just under
the radar. We have the usual assortment of brilliant pop singles in songs like
“Mayor of Simpleton” and “King for a Day”. The most interesting moments are
the more adventurous, but no less poppy gems like “Poor Skeleton Steps Out”.
[<em>Memory</em>: The Rochester music store Record Archive is notorious for having a
huge used vinyl section that is mostly undesirable releases in poor condition.
This was the first good album I found there in good condition, and is one of
few used purchases I have ever made at that shop.]</p></li>
