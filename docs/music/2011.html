<h1>2011 Albums<a class="headerlink" href="#albums" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I bought a house in 2011, and all of a sudden I had way more room for records.
This was when I really committed myself to building a new music collection in
vinyl records that would better represent my tastes and world view as a adult.
This was also the year that Spotify was released and changed my consumption of
music forever.
When I listened to my playlist of favorites for this year, I was struck by how
many of the releases shared a consistent sound. This was definitely the year of
synthpop revival, chillwave and the seeds of vaporwave. 2011 has a distinct
sound and I like it. Much of this music was designed to invoke non-specific
memories of the 1980s. In retrospect, this music doesn’t really have many
direct connections to that decade, but it all sure sounds like 2011.</p>

<li><p><em>Night of Hunters</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - Tori makes peace with her classical
music roots and makes a brilliant record. Playing these reinterpretations of
instrumental music shows off her extreme skills on the piano. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw
her in NYC on this tour, and it was an amazing show. Having a rock band and a
chamber ensemble was a great way to see her music presented. “Shattering Sea”
was quite the show opener. Also found a great sushi place right by the venue.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Burst Apart</em> by <strong>The Antlers</strong> - They make a strong follow up to their
NPR famous prior record. This has the same enjoyable loud/soft dynamic, and
these guys are even giving into the synthpop bug a bit. Very pretty, and
something I am always in the mood for. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw them at Crossing
Brooklyn Ferry the next year and I was struck by how refined their performance
had become as a band. It was both a good and bad thing.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Parallax</em> by <strong>Atlas Sound</strong> - For a brief moment Bradford Cox was the most
compelling thing in music. His work from about 2008 to 2011 with Deerhunter
and this solo project is universally outstanding. The catching little, reverb
soaked tracks on offer here are both obvious and completely unique. “Angel is
Broken” is one of my favorite songs of all time. [<em>Memory</em>: Yet another great
performance from Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, Cox absolutely nailed almost this
entire album in a compelling solo set.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Smile</em> by <strong>The Beach Boys</strong> - All of a sudden it was a real album that
actually exists. It was surprising how exactly it matched the Brian Wilson
version that been released years prior. Was it made to match, was it always
supposed to sound this way? It sounds pretty much done, especially by 2010s
indie rock standards, and wow this fits right in with the music of the time.
Warm poppy psychedelic music at its finest, the world is better with this
album in it. [<em>Memory</em>: I was in the middle of a huge Beach Boys phase when
this was announced, and I bought the giant box set with all the extras.
Probably more than I needed.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Native Speaker</em> by <strong>Braids</strong> - I really miss the first iteration of this
band. The combination of spare electronics, strong percussion, and yelping
vocals was the best in Canadian indie rock in the strongest era of Canadian
music. They would make one more song in this style “In Kind” which is my
favorite song from this decade, though the album it would appear on is mostly
boring electronica. That is not the case here, this is one of the most
exciting records in my collection. [<em>Memory</em>: I loved the video of the band
performing “Plath Heart” and “In Kind” at the Polaris Prize gala in 2011, I
wish that I could still stream that amazing performance.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Zonoscope</em> by <strong>Cut/Copy</strong> - Much of the synthpop being made in 2011 was
alluding to an imagined, but non-existent alternative version of the 1980s.
Not these guys, they would have fit right in that decade. One of best “new
wave guy” voices of all time. I’ve always wondered if their name was an
acknowledgement of how much this music borrows from the past. Who cares, its
like New Order are still around making great new music. [<em>Memory</em>: Jumping up
and down to this stuff at Pitchfork 2011 with all the indie kids]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Valley</em> by <strong>Eisley</strong> - The kids in this band grew up quickly. The
primary singer and songwriter (one of the Dupree sisters, I’ve never been able
to keep them straight) was going through a divorce and this is the main theme
on this record. No more dreamscapes about horses growing out of the ground,
the mood is alternately angry and reflective. It worked surprisingly well.
Also, the vocal harmonies of the three sisters are outstanding. [<em>Memory</em>: By
the time this had come out, I had forgot about this band, but an amazing
performance of the title track on YouTube directed my attention to this gem]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Build A Rocket Boys</em> by <strong>Elbow</strong> - Another extremely solid record that I
really enjoy, but never need to own on vinyl. There is something about the
sound of this music that will only ever make it a 3.5 stars out of 5. If they
made more songs as interesting as the Krautrock inspired “The Birds” this
might reach the next level in my collection. [<em>Memory</em>: At the time I was
almost disappointed that I like another record by these guys, since it somehow
feels a little obvious and boring to me at the same time?]</p></li>
<li><p><em>“unlearn.” by **Fergus &amp; Geronimo*</em> - Very few artists have tried to follow
in the steps of Frank Zappa, but these guys have managed to do it pretty well.
This owes huge debt to the early Mothers records, and I like the sense of
humor way better, including the Pitchfork diss track, “Wanna Know What I Would
Do If I Was You?” [<em>Memory</em>: Immediately before the Spotify era, I was using
an curated, online discovery radio service the name of which I can’t remember.
For some reason, the classic lowfi single by these guys, “Harder Than It’s
Ever Been”, was listed on a “This is Chillwave/Glofi” list. That is why I
blind bought this record on vinyl. It was great, but very different from that
early single.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Father, Son, Holy Ghost</em> by <strong>Girls</strong> - Their career was short but highly
productive. The third record gets a little proggy at times, but this is the
same kind of tightly put together pop music as the first two. [<em>Memory</em>: In
2020 I made a Discogs catalog of my records and I was surprised to discover I
never bought a vinyl copy of this. I’m glad I fixed that while it is still in
print.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Let England Shake</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - The wildest left turn in a career
filled with them. Still singing exclusively in her church voice, PJ writes a
bunch of songs exploring Britain’s imperial past. The saxophone and auto-harp
are starting to replace the guitar. This is an artist peaking later in their
career [<em>Memory</em>: I was really excited for this record, and followed the
release cycle closely. I remember there was a preview performance of a track
at some sort of UK National TV broadcast that the queen was supposedly watching
at home. I wonder what she thought of PJ’s song about the missteps of the
British Empire  and the wild plume of feathers that she wore in her hair.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The January EP</em> by <strong>Here We Go Magic</strong> - I’m glad we got a few more songs
from what was the best iteration of this band. After this, Radiohead’s
producer would ruin things with too much production and too much focus on the
lead singer/songwriter. This era was defined by contributions from an ensemble
of musicians, particularly the warm fuzzy production stylings of bassist Jen
Turner. It was a short but brilliant run by the five piece version. [<em>Memory</em>:
Few albums have disappointed me more than the one that came after this one.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>True Loves</em> by <strong>Hooray for Earth</strong> - [<strong>2011 FAVORITE</strong>] It took a while for
them to release
their first full length, but it was worth the wait. This stood out during a
time when most indie rock was intentionally lofi or otherwise rough around the
edges. The album is textured and slickly produced. There is a pleasant warmth
to the songs, and everything feels nostalgic about a musical past that never
existed. One of my all time favorites. [<em>Memory</em>: This is the band that made
me find common interests with the Rochester music blog I would participate in
for a little while.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>We Are the Arms</em> by <strong>Gabriel Kahane</strong> - Gabe is a singer songwriter that
grew out of the music school music scene in New York City. This is music that
manages to be very beautiful, despite being very complex. “Last Dance” is
still his finest work. [<em>Memory</em>: My enjoyment of this record is what made me
realize I wasn’t really cut out to write for the indie rock blog I was
contributing to. I did write a post about this song, but it felt wrong.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Too Beautiful to Work</em> by <strong>The Luyas</strong> - The Canadian music renaissance was
starting to wind down, but there were a few great new artists still popping
up. Many of them would start off strong, and then trail off. The
Luyas would never again match the minimalist brilliance of this record. It is
hard to believe they were able to ever get a French horn and zither sound to
work as well as they did here. [<em>Memory</em>: I was able to attend the 2011 NxNE
music festival as part of the press for the blog that I contributed to. I saw
a memorable performance by this band early in my first evening club hopping
with my press pass.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wits End</em> by <strong>Cass McCombs</strong> - Sounds like something out of the 70s. Somber
songwriter music, with some really interesting light psych elements.
[<em>Memory</em>: I have a weird relationship with this record, as I continually
forget how much I like it. I even forgot to add it to this writeup/picture,
even though it made it through the initial filtering process and is clearly in
my notes.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Floral Shoppe</em> by <strong>Mcintosh Plus</strong> - This is the first album I’m writing
about that isn’t on Spotify. That is because this is illegal music. I didn’t
realize that vaporwave was happening until it was mostly over. This is
generally pointed to as the masterpiece of the genre, and I tend to agree. It
is amazing how the various R&amp;B tracks and sophista-pop tunes get morphed into
a catchy avant garde swirl. [<em>Memory</em>: I spent months tracking down a
reasonably priced copy of the vinyl “bootleg” that isn’t really a bootleg,
they just call it that because this can’t be legally sold due to being
comprised completely of other people’s music]</p></li>
<li><p><em>We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves</em> by <strong>John Maus</strong> - A
masterful combination of synthpop and goth, this is an exceptional record. I
don’t think I’m politically well aligned with this guy, and in retrospect the
right wing agenda seems embedded in the title of this album. The music is
first rate though. [<em>Memory</em>: I was introduced to this guy at a strange
performance at a Pitchfork aftershow at Schuba’s in Chicago. The dude just
screams over a backing track of his songs. People mosh, it is weird.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Player Piano</em> by <strong>Memory Tapes</strong> - I don’t think this guy liked getting
lumped in with the chillwave crew. He responded with a weird kind of electronic
pop music. Very bright and upbeat with little bursts of eccentric darkness. A
wholely unique work, and what I see when I think back on what I miss about this
period of popular music. [<em>Memory</em>: This record was hotly anticipated by the
Pitchfork people, but they were completely confounded by it]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The English Riviera</em> by <strong>Metronomy</strong> - This is by far their most straight
forward pop record, and it lacks the instrumental experiments of most of their
other work. The best moments on their records tend to sound like a kid playing
with all the sounds on the casio, and this mood is perfected on “The Look.”
[<em>Memory</em>: For some reason it took a while for me to warm up to this record,
and I only added it to my favorites about 10 years after its release]</p></li>
<li><p><em>All Things Must Unwind</em> by <strong>My Brightest Diamond</strong> - Of all the artists
working in the area of pop and “fancy music” coming together, I don’t know
that anyone does it better than Shara Nova (formerly Worden). On this album
she goes all the way and uses a classical chamber music ensemble as a backing
band (yMusic, more on them later). [<em>Memory</em>: I saw Shara live four times on
this album cycle, immediately before and after release at Bugjar, and twice
with yMusic at Music Now 2011 and Crossing Brooklyn Ferry 2012]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Awake</em> by <strong>Now Ensemble</strong> - Straight up contemporary classical that manages
avoid all the screechy violin bullshit and be enjoyable. They also manage to
do something Mr. Holland couldn’t, make electric guitar fit without seeming
contrived. “Change” is by far the best thing that Judd Greenstein” has ever
written, and the performance here is first rate. The CDs start to creep into
the pictures starting here. [<em>Memory</em>: Seeing these guys
perform at Crossing Brooklyn Ferry synchronized to the video for the track]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Belong</em> by <strong>The Pains of Being Pure at Heart</strong> - They pick up a bit of a
grunge hard edge while keeping that delightfully gentle disposition. This is
the kind of music that made me feel nostalgic a couple years after it was
released. [<em>Memory</em>: I felt compelled to collect all the 45s from their first
two records. I’m glad I did, they are some of the best singles from this whole
era. “Belong” is an especially amazing track.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tomboy</em> by <strong>Panda Bear</strong> - It is strange to look back on how big <em>Animal
Collective</em> and their solo projects were ten years ago. I don’t know that any
other band has dropped off the radar quite as much as they have. Some of it
really holds up though, and no more so that this release. It seems to answer
the question, “what if Brian Wilson made electronic music?”. A minimalist
masterpiece. [<em>Memory</em>: Having an excited conversation about how great this
was with one of my blog colleagues while I was attending a Penn State
volleyball match]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dye it Blonde</em> by <strong>Smith Westerns</strong> - Sometimes a band seems to have one
amazing record in them, and immediately after release they disappear never to
be heard of again. This record really stood out in the 2011 indie scene with
its strong guitar focus and singalong choruses. Almost like T. Rex lite.
[<em>Memory</em>: Seeing these guys at Pitchfork 2011 was kind of remarkable, since
this didn’t really fit the Pitchfork scene at the time]</p></li>
<li><p><em>New History Warfare Vol 2: Judges</em> by <strong>Colin Stetson</strong> - I always wonder why
music this strange sometimes hits the popular consciousness, but I’m glad it
does. I doubt I would have found this if it had’t made the NPR music scene.
Our bro Colin is putting microphones all over his saxophone and mixing the
results into percussive electronica, without any keyboards. [<em>Memory</em>: Once
the Spotify algorithm realized I liked this guy, it wouldn’t stop playing his
music for me, even if it didn’t really fit in with what I was looking for at
the time]</p></li>
<li><p><em>We Are Rising</em> by <strong>Son Lux</strong> - This is the peak of NPRs influence over
popular music. The creation of this was the focus of the highly publicized
“Project Album”. The resulting product was pretty great as well. In retrospect
this feels like one of the first shots fired in the fusion with the
contemporary classical scene. It is also a nice transitionary record between
the early minimalist hip hop of the first record, and the massive layered
sounds to come. [<em>Memory</em>: It is hard to listen to this without thinking of
all the making of videos NPR posted during its creation]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Underneath the Pine</em> by <strong>Toro y Moi</strong> - Again this guy is ahead of the
times. He made one of the first distinctly chillwave records in the year
before, now he is in front of the alternative R&amp;B movement that was the next big
thing. I only wish he kept making music that was this interesting. [<em>Memory</em>:
I blind bought this on vinyl. Spinning the record for the first time was a big
surprise, but a great experience]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Grace for Drowning</em> by <strong>Steven Wilson</strong> - Wilson was producing a remaster
series for King Crimson at the time, and it shows. Maybe the only time someone
has attempted to follow <em>Lizard</em> era Crimson. A very dark and mysterious
record. This record made it clear <strong>Porcupine Tree</strong> was never coming back, if
he was going to make this kind of prog under his own name. “Raider II” is one
of the greatest prog epics of all time. [<em>Memory</em>: I actually came to this
music first through the live version on the Record Store Day exclusive
<em>Catalogue / Preserve / Amass</em>]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Beautiful Mechanical</em> by <strong>yMusic</strong> - Probably no group of musicians was more
key to the classical music incursion into pop music than these folks. This
album is the perfect artifact from that time. The music is mostly written by
artists more on the pop side of things, but the results are very much “new
music” for chamber ensemble. If only Sufjan could have participated, and this
would feel like a complete statement. [<em>Memory</em>: I supported the Kickstarter
to take this album the final mile and received a signed CD for my trouble. It
has signatures from the ensemble and notable figures like Ryan Lott, Annie
Clark, and Shara Worden. It is the perfect keepsake for a moment in musical
history.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Glossolalia</em> by <strong>Zambri</strong> - I became aware of the Zambri sisters through
their participation in the <strong>Hooray for Earth</strong> record that came out this
year. I found their song “On Call” on SoundCloud when looking for things to
write about on the blog. It is a striking mixture of hard industrial, and New
Jack Swing. This whole EP is quite the stylistic grab bag also touching on
goth and 90s R&amp;B. Such a wonderful musical anomaly. [<em>Memory</em>: This is the one
time in writing the blog I felt smart for discovering an unknown band. It
wouldn’t be long until all the big blogs were covering this band as well]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Conatus</em> by <strong>Zola Jesus</strong> - Goth is one of my favorite historical music
genres, but I hate most of the new stuff in that area. This is one of the
exceptions. She has made a stunning atmospheric, electro-goth record here, with
some top notch vocals. Maybe the closest anyone else has come to the <strong>Dead
Can Dance</strong> mood. [<em>Memory</em>: I’ve always had a tenuous relationship with the
Pitchfork scene, but I discovered this record reading their top albums of 2011
list back in the day]</p></li>
