<p>When I look at the below image, I can confidently say that I didn’t hear any of
these records in the year of their release. I was very familiar with, and a fan
of many songs off of these albums, but none had found their way into my
collection. This is partly because I was very much in the peak of my backward
looking Beatlemania, and making my first explorations into growing favorites
like <strong>Pink Floyd</strong> and <strong>David Bowie</strong>. It was also because many of the new
artists I was interested in, seemed to conflict with the religious convictions
of my parents. It is strange to think about now, but back then artists like
<strong>Soundgarden</strong>, <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong>, and even <strong>Jamiroquai</strong> felt slightly
dangerous and out of step with the conservative values of my family.</p>
<p>Thinking about this selection today, this feels like a pivot year between the
rock heavy early 90s and the rise of pop in the latter half of the decade. There
are also quite a few indie classics there, including a few landmark albums that
would be very influential on the dominant music trends of the next decade
(<strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong>, <strong>Stereolab</strong>, <strong>Olivia Tremor Control</strong>,
<strong>Tortoise</strong>). Finally, Britpop is starting to reach full bloom with classics
from <strong>Divine Comedy</strong> and <strong>Manic Street Preachers</strong>, and an American band has
decided to join in (<strong>Lilys</strong>). If there a single dominant theme here, it is
without question garage rock. That influence can be heard in artists as diverse
as <strong>Olivia Tremor Control</strong>, <strong>Pearl Jam</strong>, <strong>Lilys</strong> and especially here in
the album by <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong>. Its really clear to see the roots of 2000s
indie in many of the albums listed here.</p>

<li><p><em>Boys for Pele</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - A remarkable record, produced by an artist
who was experiencing a significant level of artistic freedom for the first
time. While we have the first elements of the electronic music that would
dominate the next few records, this is mostly still an acoustic, piano driven
affair. The song structure and the fundamental structure of the album is quite
different from anything that had really come before by any artist. The lyrics
are more impenetrable than anything on her first two records, but they are
evocative of multitude of emotions. I don’t know that there is another album
where I understand so poorly what the artist is singing about, but I know
exactly what they mean. So many of my favorite songs of all time are on this
album, and it is one that I will never tire of. [<em>Memory</em>: When I was in grad
school, I met a woman studying in another program through a friend in her lab.
We connected very deeply over this record, and the next three times our friend
group met up at the bar, we spent the entire evening chatting. I’m pretty sure
everyone else thought we were going to start dating. I might have even thought
that for a brief moment, but we really both just really like that album, and
the artist.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tidal</em> by <strong>Fiona Apple</strong> - This feels so conventional by the modern
standards of the artist. The first album is definitely quite a bit more
straightforward than what was to come, but no less interesting. The moody,
singer-songwriter material on offer here is just as stunning today as it was
back then. “Criminal” was the big hit back then, as much for its lolita-esque
music video, as the song it was promoting. Most of the other material holds up
much better today, especially “Shadowboxer” and the softer tracks like
“Sullen Girl” and “Never is a Promise”. [<em>Memory</em>: I got my copy of this album
from my sister as a hand me down in the summer of 1998. She didn’t connect
with it beyond “Criminal”. I was in the heights of my <strong>Tori</strong>-mania and this
was a great fit for that time in my life. This album brings back vivid
memories of driving my metallic purple 1997 Dodge Neon to the Penn
State satellite campus I attended in Reading, PA. Many of those freshman
mornings I would have this in the Sony Discman that was playing though a
cassette deck adapter.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>If You’re Feeling Sinister</em> by <strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong> - One of their best
albums, but unlike most fans, I do not consider it to be their very best. This
is a tremendous indie-folk record, but for me it isn’t quite as effective as
the more spare, unpolished EPs that came before, or the slicker poppier music
that would come in the next decade. However, there are some great tracks here,
especially “Like Dylan in the Movies” and “Seeing Other People”. [<em>Memory</em>:
These guys dominated my listening in the 2004-2006 time frame. This is the
soundtrack to the end of my academic career and start of my first job.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>First Band on the Moon</em> by <strong>The Cardigans</strong> - “Lovefool” was a massive hit,
and while a great song, it sells these guys a bit short. The kind of pop music
that can only come from Scandinavia, this is sweet, but surprisingly moody
music. It would get even darker from here on out, but there is a real chill to
the atmospherics and songwriting on this record. [<em>Memory</em>: I was listening to
this a lot in the Summer of 1999, and it reminds me very much of my first
engineering internship. I would listen to CDs on my Windows NT machine that I
used make CAD drawings. This was one of the discs that was on repeat.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Casanova</em> by <strong>Divine Comedy</strong> - There are many of the typical elements here:
the sense of humor, the chamber pop sensibility, the layered harmonies by the
artist. However, this is the closest this guy has ever come to actually making
Britpop. It is the eccentric kind of Britpop made by the likes of <strong>Blur</strong>,
and it isn’t quite all the way there, but if you squint, it is there. For many
folks this is the best record, for me it is in the middle of a very strong
pack of records. [<em>Memory</em>: This was the second album I tried from this guy
after losing my mind listening to <strong>Promenade</strong> repeatedly for about 5 years.
I remember wondering why I waited so long to dig deeper.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dance Hall at Louise Point</em> by <strong>John Parish &amp; PJ Harvey</strong> - This is the
first record in the quieter, artier sound that would become her predominant
style in her more recent work. There still are some aggressive, abrasive
moments here, but they unfold in a creeping, pensive way that is also very
representative of the latter day Polly Jean. “Heela” is such a remarkable
song, and will always be one of my favorites. Even though we would get a few
more records in a more conventional rock style, this is the start of the PJ we
know and love today. [<em>Memory</em>: When I was working my way through her catalog
in the 2007 time frame, I bought a used CD copy of this for about a dollar and
didn’t know what to make of it. This took me a while to fully appreciate, but
it is not one of my very favorites.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Traveling Without Moving</em> by <strong>Jamiroquai</strong> - It is hard to think about this
record without picturing that legendary video for “Virtual Insanity” and I’m
sure I would never have heard this album without that amazing promo clip. That
said, this is a funky, highly enjoyable affair that is more than a little
derivative of <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong>. Much like the master it has patterned itself
after, what we get here is a pleasant mix of funky upbeat tunes, and pretty
soulful ballads. [<em>Memory</em>: This makes me think of a quant music “format” that
I collected in the late 90s. CDs were expensive (and in some cases, evil in
the religion I was raised in) and I couldn’t always acquire the latest tunes I
liked from TV or radio. The internet of the late 90s provided me an
approximate solution, the MIDI file. I downloaded the minimalist, instrumental
sequencer versions of popular tunes that I didn’t have for real. I remember
downloading a particularly impressive version of “Virtual Insanity” in the
(new at the time) XG MIDI format. It didn’t have the vocal track, but I could
still enjoy that funky groove.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Better Can’t Make Your Life Better</em> by <strong>Lilys</strong> - I love <strong>The Kinks</strong> and
so apparently does Kurt Heasley, the man behind <strong>Lilys</strong>. This feels like a
love letter to the pre “Village Green” <strong>Kinks</strong> and it is expertly done. The
90s were a time of significant interest in the sounds of the mid 60s, and this
is a expert recreation and modernization of the garage rock sound. [<em>Memory</em>:
There was a vinyl copy of this at one of my favorite Rochester shops (The Bop
Shop) for probably about 5 years before I finally pulled the trigger and
picked it up. Why was I delaying, this is wonderful stuff!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Everything Must Go</em> by <strong>Manic Street Preachers</strong> - These guys were always
one of the heavier BritPop acts, but this is where the balladry and pop
sensibility started to really creep in. That said, it totally works. A really
polished and literate set of tracks that never get old. The epic “Elvis
Impersonator…” returns to one of their favorite topics, the relationships
between the UK and America. Admittedly their frank consideration of that topic
is why they never really made it over here, and why I didn’t hear anything
from them until the mid 2000s. I would have absolutely loved it back then, and
I certainly do now! [<em>Memory</em>: “A Design for Life” is the ultimate BritPop
anthem. It was made to be screamed along with by a Glastonbury festival crowd.
I got a noise violation letter for jamming it too loud at in my State College
apartment in 2007.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Older</em> by <strong>George Michael</strong> - This album sold millions of copies, but not as
many millions of the two prior, and therefore was perceived as a failure at
the time. Today it sounds like a revelation. A sophisticated, mature affair
with some of his best songwriting and vocal performances, this was not fully
appreciated at release. “Jesus to a Child” is a remarkable song, perhaps his
very finest. Everything has such a warm, atmospheric vibe. Maybe the best 90s
sophista-pop record. [<em>Memory</em>: I certainly remember the singles from this
record getting played (especially on VH1), and had them on a greatest hits
compilation, but I didn’t listen to the whole album until 2021. After reading
a biography on the artist I streamed all the records and was blown away by
this one.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Who Can you Trust</em> by <strong>Morcheeba</strong> - The big breakout for these guys, and a
wonderful evolution of trip-hop. The kind of smooth and elegant record that
you could replay to infinity and not tire of. It is almost like
<strong>Portishead</strong> has been polished up and made TV commercial ready, but somehow
still very compelling. [<em>Memory</em>: Early in the 2020 pandemic year, I made an
effort to listen through to albums I acquired in the CD era and had forgot
about. I rediscovered this brilliant LP though that process.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dusk at Cubist Castle</em> by <strong>The Olivia Tremor Control</strong> - I like the pop
songs on this record quite a bit, but the ambient, instrumental parts just
don’t work as well as the ones on the next (and final) record. No denying how
influential everything about this would be on a whole generation of psych rock
revivalists. [<em>Memory</em>: These guys always remind me of my move to Rochester,
NY. I was very into them around that time, and they would also reissue all
their records on vinyl around that time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In Sides</em> by <strong>Orbital</strong> - The definitive album oriented techno record. They
always liked to work in longer forms, but this whole album is built around
10-20 minute chunks of music. I’m always going back and forth between this and
the brown album as my favorite, but without question “Out There Somewhere” is
there absolute best moment. Techno in general hasn’t aged well, but this still
sounds amazing today. I really love the way they mix in real instruments with
all the electronics here. It gives a texture that a lot of the electronic
music of the day did  not have [<em>Memory</em>: One of my favorite things to play on
a run, it is hard to not think about exercise when I hear this record.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>No Code</em> by <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> - This has always been my favorite of their albums,
and I feel like the world has caught up with me. The stripped back garage
mentality suits them well, and captures their live nature better than any of
their other work. Short, hard-hitting songs that avoid the extended bombast
that they sometimes tend to fall into. They also mix in one of their sweetest
balads in “Off He Goes”, and the greatest <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> song not sung by Eddie
Vedder in “Mankind”. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought a used copy of this at a secondhand
store called Cash Converters around 1999. I payed a dollar for it, showing how
unappreciated it was at the time. I later payed almost 40 bucks for the vinyl
reissue, and many others were happy to do so as well.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</em> by <strong>R.E.M.</strong> - A clear attempt to return to a more
arty, low-key sound after the straightforward rock of <strong>Monster</strong>. This was
very under the radar at the time, but many people (including myself) learned
to appreciate this over time. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought my CD copy of this record
when I was working as a summer intern at NASA Glenn in the summer of 2023.
There was a message board where you could post things for sale, and I bought
this from someone along with <strong>Hum</strong>’s <em>You’d Prefer an Astronaut</em>.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Down on the Upside</em> by <strong>Soundgarden</strong> - In my opinion, this is a highly
underrated follow-up to their breakout hit <em>Superunknown</em>. A return to more
conventional hard rock, with some elements of the singer-songwriter fare that
would dominate the early <strong>Chris Cornell</strong> solo career. This would have been a
great way for them to wrap up, except for the ill advised reunion in the
2010s. [<em>Memory</em>: “Blow Up the Outside World” was one of the very first MP3s I
downloaded from the internet. Weirdly I downloaded it from the FTP server
ran by a fellow student who I didn’t really care for at my high school. “Free”
music conquers all barriers.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</em> by <strong>Stereolab</strong> - 90s indie was wildly diverse and
often hard to categorize, and this might be the definitive album of the era.
Electronic tinged rock music with a Krautrock groove and a pop soul, there is
a little bit of everything here. This was the doorway to so many places for
me: <strong>Can</strong>, <strong>Kraftwerk</strong>, <strong>Bell and Sebastian</strong>, <strong>Of Montreal</strong>, and who
knows what else. [<em>Memory</em>: Maybe the most important record I sought out
because of the AllMusicGuide genre summaries. They considered this an indie
landmark, and that isn’t putting it strongly enough.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tiny Music…</em> by <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong> - Much like <em>No Code</em> (above), I
feel ahead of the times picking this record out as this band’s finest hour.
The combination of garage, psychedelia, and glam on offer here is a very
unique and memorable sound from a group that was often dismissed as
derivative. Here they sound very much ahead of the times, and almost sound a
little prophetic of the indie rock that would dominate the turn of the
millennium. [<em>Memory</em>: When I look at the cover of this record, I can’t help
but picture the Columbia House music club mailers and magazine adds that
seemed to feature this album for the better part of 1996-97.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Millions Now Living will Never Die</em> - This may be the definitive post rock
record. A straight up fusion of punk and jazz, this sound has been attempted
so many times, but very rarely this well. I sometimes wonder if these guys are
why I grew up to like jazz (particularly electro-jazz) so much. [<em>Memory</em>: The
name of this album has always fascinated me, since it is titled after the
greatest lie ever told by the religion I was raised in. I wonder how that came
to be?]</p></li>

<h2>1997<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have mentioned this several times, but it is important to know that I worked
on this project starting in 2020 and moving backwards in time. As a result,
milestones were observed in reverse. When I look at the records below, I can see
the influence of three very big factors for the very first time. First, this was
the year that I would have my first jobs that would bring in money that I could
use to purchase albums of my own choosing. Second, I got my drivers license
which allowed me to transport myself to the mall or Best Buy/Circuit City where
I could personally select the music I was interested in. This means for the
first time there are quite a few records on the list that were something that I
purchased with my own money in the year of release.</p>
<p>The third big event was something the whole world was going through at the same
time, the Internet. We didn’t yet have MP3s for music discovery, but static
webpages of dial-up and Web 1.0 were a wealth of information about the latest
activity and releases from my favorite artists. We had recently subscribed to
AOL at home, and it opened my eyes to a range of information about pop music and
a variety of other topics.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/1997.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1997" src="../_images/1997.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Primeirs Symptomes</em> by <strong>Air</strong> - An EP that serves as a great summary of what
makes these guys great. Light and pleasant French electronica, with an indie
rawness that made it sound more warm than slick. [<em>Memory</em>: I was aware of
this disk for years before I got a copy. The physical release was always an
expensive import, but through the magic of eMusic, I would get a digital copy
years later, and finally had the complete catalog of this band.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Earthling</em> by <strong>David Bowie</strong> - I’m proud to say that I have always been a
fan of 90s Bowie, even when others (even if they wont admit it now) were
saying he was over the hill. Some of the electronic sounds are dated now, but
it only adds to the charm. That Bowie magic is still here in a big way.
“Battle for Britain” is one of my absolute favorites of his without
qualification. [<em>Memory</em>: This brings together two of my biggest interests in
1997: Bowie and The Internet. Bowie was famously and early advocate for the
web, and one of the first artists to fully harness its power. I vividly
remember viewing a RealVideo encoded file at extremely low bitrate of the
video for the lead single “Little Wonder”. The sounds and the technology blew
my teenage mind.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Karma</em> by <strong>Delerium</strong> - [<strong>1997 FAVORITE</strong>] - My absolute favorite by these
guys also happens to be their most widely known. I do enjoy the <strong>Sarah
McLachlan</strong> fronted mega-hit “Silence” (and the late 90s is the only time
something like this would be a hit) but my favorite is the stunning “Euphoria
(Firefly)”. The combination of light industrial beats and world music
exoticism reached a peak on this record. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember playing this
for one of my friends on a drive, and their reaction was: “So this is the kind
of music you are into now, huh?”]</p></li>
<li><p><em>A Short Album About Love</em> by <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> - The artist claims to
have written this album before ever actually being in love, and I think it
shows. There is something charmingly detached about this collection of love
songs. A lot of the usual humour (“If”) and warmth (“Everybody Knows”) that
would typify the second act for this guy. Probably the beginning of the fully
mature work for Neil Hannon, and one of his absolute finest moments.
[<em>Memory</em>: When the vinyl reissues came out in 2020, it really made me see the
whole discography in a new light. I don’t know if any album climbed my
personal ranking more than this one. It really is the kind of thing that needs
to be listened to in whole, and hits hard in its short running length.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>So Much for the Afterglow</em> by <strong>Everclear</strong> - Music from this era hasn’t aged
very gracefully. Mostly a collection of post-grunge, nu-metal, and pop-punk,
late 90s rock was a collection of fads that haven’t generally stood the test
of time. The combination of power pop and mature singer songwriter themes on
display here have held up way better than most of the rock radio favorites of
the day. Also a pretty killer record from start to finish, which is also a
rarity for the era. [<em>Memory</em>: This is one of the few records from this year’s
list that I was actually into at the time of release. I really enjoyed the radio
hits, but it was the deep cut “Why I Don’t Believe in God” that made this a
classic album of my teen years. It really connected with where I was at this
point in my life, and also made me love the banjo as a rock instrument…until
a bunch of hacks ruined that in the 2010s.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>F# A# ∞</em> by <strong>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</strong> - The start of the journey for
these guys, and for the genre of chamber, apocalyptic post-rock as well.
Everything that they continue to do is already fully formed here. I don’t come
back to this one as much, because I feel like the formula was refined in the
later albums, but I always enjoy it when I do. Perhaps a bit more ambient with
meandering soundscapes that have been reduced in later efforts, and with a
generally lighter touch than the crescendo heavy later works. [<em>Memory</em>: The
<strong>Godspeed</strong> records seem to have always been perpetually in print on vinyl,
and I was able to buy this and complete my catalog of LPs back in the dark
ages of circa 2009.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mi  Media Naranja</em> by <strong>Labradford</strong> - In the 90s and early 2000s, <strong>Ennio
Morricone</strong> inspired post-rock was a fairly productive sub-genre. A lot of the
music sounds very much the same, and for me, this is the best product of that
scene. Moody, vaguely western soundscapes, that sound hopeless and spacious.
I’m not in the mood for this very often these days, but wow was I about 15-20
years ago. [<em>Memory</em>: This is the kind of record I would have never found
without the AllMusicGuide. Fairly obscure when I found it, and even more
obscure today, the AMG article on post-rock considered it a landmark of the
genre. I’m glad that it pointed me this way.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Flaming Pie</em> by <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> - In retrospect, this feels like one of
the most important albums in a very important career. For the first time you can
hear him coming to terms with his <strong>Beatles</strong> past, and fully engaging with a
musical future that both considers with what came before, and what lies ahead.
This was also the last record with the input and presence of his collaborator
in music and life, Linda. This is where things really started to come
together, and the brilliant final act of a brilliant musical career had it’s
start. [<em>Memory</em>: This was definitely the record I was most excited for at the
time. I was in the peak of my <strong>Beatles</strong> &amp; <strong>McCartney</strong> fandom, and this was
the first new release since I had discovered these artists (other than the
archival “Anthology” and “Live at the BBC” releases). I remember logging into
the MPL Records website to view the latest posts to the “Flamming Pie Gazette”
that provided updates on the production of the record. I was so excited to
hear a short clip of “The World Tonight” in RealVideo format. This record
invokes nostalgia not just for the music, but also the early web.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Surfacing</em> by <strong>Sarah McLachlan</strong> - This is one of those records that I
really enjoy, but wonder if its lasting effect has been negative. Up to this
point, women’s music had been arguably the highlight of 90s pop/rock. The likes
of <strong>PJ Harvey</strong>, <strong>Tori Amos</strong>, <strong>Alanis</strong> and countless other women were
making stunning, edgy work that was finding its way to the mainstream against
all odds. Once the record execs got a look at this lush, pretty record, it
felt like there was a massive shift in what they were willing to promote. I
certainly don’t want to blame <strong>McLachlan</strong> who is a master at this kind of
music, but why couldn’t it live side by side with all that other really
awesome stuff that wasn’t as easy to fit into the background of TV
commercials? [<em>Memory</em>: I heard “Building a Mystery” for the first time while
exercising at my physical therapist during a recovery session after breaking
my left ankle.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cherry Peel</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong> - Where it all began for Kevin Barnes, it
sounds stunningly small compared to where he would take his music. A
collection of good natured, lowfi pop songs with imaginative lyrics and
melodies, this project was solid from day one. “I can’t Stop Your Memory” is a
tiny masterpiece of retro-pop. It almost sounds like the 1967 <strong>Beatles</strong>
going back and making music the way they did in 1961. [<em>Memory</em>: Thanks to
eMusic, I probably heard this album years before I otherwise would have. The
cheap mp3 downloads allowed me to explore obscure back catalog records like
this one years before streaming made this trivial.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Brighten the Corners</em> by <strong>Pavement</strong> - A bit more put together than we are
used to from these guys,  but still had enough of that shambolic magic. That
said, this is clearly the work of a band and a front man who were starting to
outgrow their fundamental concept. [<em>Memory</em>: About 20 years after the release
of this record, Spotify radio kept playing the song “Harness Your Hopes” and I
couldn’t figure out why I didn’t know the track. Apparently left of this
album, how in the world did one of the most representatively perfect
<strong>Pavement</strong> songs not make the track list?]</p></li>
<li><p><em>OK Computer</em> by <strong>Radiohead</strong> - For a significant number of folks, this is
the best album of the 90s, but it isn’t even my top <strong>Radiohead</strong>
album of the decade. That said, it still is a classic transition record,
spanning their Britpop roots and the dreary, mixed-genre weirdness to come. I
feel like the best moments here are the quiet tracks like “Exit Music (For a
Film)” and “Lucky”. A few albums later they would learn to rock out more
effectively again. [<em>Memory</em>: Ironically (given the role they would later play
in legal downloads) this album reminds me more of the Napster era than any
other. I wasn’t totally ready to buy into these guys as the next big thing,
but I was happy to download a bunch of their stuff for no money. I now have
this, and many of their albums, on both CD and vinyl.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Unsound Methods</em> by <strong>Recoil</strong> - I don’t find myself listening to <strong>Alan
Wilder</strong>’s dark ambient project much these days, but I certainly found it very
compelling 20 or so years ago. Some of this sounds a bit silly and dated now,
and not edgy in the way it did back then. The more goth tracks like “Incubus”
have aged better than the beat poetry based things like “Luscious Apparatus”.
Probably best enjoyed as a late 90s time capsule now. [<em>Memory</em>: I got this at
one of those “used goods” stores that were everywhere in the late 90s. The
shop (Cash Converters) was often a great source of underrated records by
popular artists, and obscure gems like this.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Either/Or</em> by <strong>Elliot Smith</strong> - This is a stunning little collection of
gentle indie rock tunes. The most beautiful anyone had made sadness sound
since <strong>Nick Drake</strong>. [<em>Memory</em>: Like many folks, I didn’t properly get into
his music until his passing in 2004. It would take me to acquire this
masterpiece, but it was one of the first bunch of Emusic downloads I made in
early 2006.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hard Normal Daddy</em> by <strong>Squarepusher</strong> - If there was ever a genre I wanted
more of, it would be whatever this is. This distinctively funky brand of
break beat laden, jazz-tronica is very unique. This guy is somewhat a genre
unto himself. That said, the early albums all sound fairly similar, and this
is far and above the best of the bunch. [<em>Memory</em>: I discovered this guy on
the jazz-tronica show on XM Beyond Jazz, and was able to get his most recent
work. I knew from the AMG and other sources, this was considered his finest
work. I would have had to import an expensive CD copy from England on Amazon,
so this was an early Amazon download for me.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Radiator</em> by <strong>Super Furry Animals</strong> - Warm and comfy indie rock, with some
clear links to late 60s <strong>Beatles</strong>-like psych. This gets lumped in with the
Britpop crowd, but that link is more temporal than musical. A really fun
record that is quite a breath of fresh air next to the dreary American rock
music of the day. [<em>Memory</em>: Another classic record that I found out about on
the various music retrospective sites of the early 2000s. Back then you had to
import CD copies of this kind of thing, and I did.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Urban Hymns</em> by <strong>The Verve</strong> - Sometimes a song can be too good that it
overshadows a fantastic album. So it is with “Bitter Sweet Symphony” and this
record. That song was so ubiquitous in 1997, that all the other gems on this
album tend to go unremembered. That soaring symphonic sample on “Symphony”
tends to obscure more subtle mini-masterpieces like “Luck Man”, “Sonnet”, and
especially “The Drugs Don’t Work”. [<em>Memory</em>: I was sitting in a high school
class (Tech Lab 2000) when one of my fellow students put on this CD, and I
heard “Bitter Sweet Symphony” for the first time. Everyone in the classroom
loved it. Weeks later I was totally sick of a song that had become massive and
unavoidable. I never considered buying a copy for myself. I wouldn’t pick up
the disk until a year or two had passed, and I was floored by what I heard.]</p></li>

<h2>1998<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This was the year that I graduated from high school and started college. I feel
like this is a time in life when I was supposed to be paying very close
attention to pop music, but I just wasn’t. My interests were more about classic
rock and the alternative acts of the recent past. That said a few of these
records were something I was into at the time, but the large majority were
discovered in the last two decades of my life. In retrospect it was a
diverse and memorable year for music. The late 90s were a crazy anything goes
time for music and the below list is very much in that spirit.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/1998.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1998" src="../_images/1998.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Moon Safari</em> by <strong>Air</strong> - Some bands go on for years, and always seem like
they are trying to live up to a massive debut record. This is one of those
cases. It’s not that they haven’t made some amazing records in the meantime,
but this one is so original and definitive it almost feels unfair to hold them
to this standard again. Such a dreamy and chill mood, there have been many
imitators of this kind of down-tempo psychedelic, electronica, but none match
this effort. A nice mix of instrumentals and vocal “pop songs”, I’ve listened
to this hundreds of times and am not the least bit sick of it. [<em>Memory</em>: As
much as I like this now, I was very resistant to it at the time. My co-worker
was listening to it non-stop in the months after its release, but I really
didn’t connect with it for some reason. It was when I heard it played before a
<strong>Creed</strong> concert (of all places!) a year or so later I realized that I
actually love it. That remains true today.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>From the Choirgirl Hotel</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong>  - [<strong>1998 FAVORITE</strong>] - The
creative peak of her early period, this is a fantastic record. I still prefer
the rawness of <strong>Pele</strong> ever so slightly, but this is definitely my second
favorite of her albums. This managed to both turn up the rock band elements,
while adding in strong elements of electronic music. The top rate vocals and
piano are are still there of course along with some of the last songwriting in
the original <strong>Tori Amos</strong> style that we would hear for quite some time. The
one two sequence of “Jackie’s Strength” and “Iieee” is one of my favorite in
music history. [<em>Memory</em>: I was already interested in this album pre-release
due to her contributions to the excellent <strong>Great Expectations: Soundtrack</strong>.
I was out washing my car on a beautiful early summer day and heard “Spark” on
WMMR. That was my entry point to one of my lifelong favorite artists.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Three EPs</em> by <strong>The Beta Band</strong> - So much more than “Dry The Rain” (as
heard in Hollywood’s version of “High Fidelity”). Admittedly the selection of
this band, record, and that specific song was perfect for the scene, as this
is exactly the kind of thing you would hear play in a late 90s independent
record store. Really interesting long-form, high rhythmic folk-inspired indie
rock songs. They didn’t last long as a band, but they left some great records
behind, and this is the best of them all. [<em>Memory</em>: Like 99% of the world, I
did find out about this from the movie “High Fidelity”. I didn’t track down a
copy of the record until a year or two later. This was one of the last
(perhaps the very last) record to become part of the “original 400” CDs in my
collection.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Music Has the Right to Children</em> by <strong>Boards of Canada</strong> - Electronic music
that manages to separate itself by its originality and uncompromising quality.
A mysterious band, these guys have released music sparingly over their career.
While there have been other high-points, this is still the definitive
statement. Much of the best from this record manages to sound like music from
a highly damaged children’s TV show (see “Roygbiv” and “Aquarius”). [<em>Memory</em>:
One of those records I can thank the early RateYourMusic for. I had actually
downloaded several of the tracks several years before I actually had the funds
to track down a copy of this somewhat expensive (at the time) release.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Gran Turismo</em> by <strong>The Cardigans</strong> - This dark and moody record was quite a
shock after the sugary pop of their first two records, and the big hits that
came with them. Still fantastic pop music, but this time with a more
introspective and atmospheric electronic backdrop. Lead vocalist Nina
Peerson’s sweet, somewhat slight voice is the perfect counterpoint for the all
the fuzzy darkness. A lost classic of sorts. [<em>Memory</em>: Of all the albums that
came out that year, this is the one I most associate with my freshman year in
college. Mostly because of “My Favorite Game” serving as the intro song for
the PlayStation classic game Gran Tursimo II. I played a lot of PS1 my
freshman year in college.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Before These Crowded Streets</em> by <strong>The Dave Matthews Band</strong> - I feel
validated that there seems to be a growing consensus that this was their best
work. Certainly the most complex and jazz inspired record, it holds my
interest in a way the other records that came before and after does not.
“Crush” is by far the finest track they have produced. [<em>Memory</em>: I was very
resistant of these guys. They always seemed like a cliche of college aged guys
in the late 90s, a demographic that I had recently joined. This was the album
that grabbed me, but I would never connect with them again.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>And you Think You Know What Life’s About</em> by <strong>Dishwalla</strong> - A few of the
post-grunge bands were doing something different, and these guys certainly
were. Inspired by shoegaze and the Britpop sounds of the day, this is an
interesting second record from a unique American band. “Once In A While” was a
minor alt rock radio hit at the time, but this album is much more interesting
in whole. [<em>Memory</em>: I really liked this record when it came out, and it
probably is because I was connecting with the sounds they were borrowing from
other, more British acts I would discover later.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fin De Siecle</em> by <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> - It can be really difficult to pick
a best album from an artist that is this consistently great. It has a little
bit of everything, the jokey fun tracks, the serious slice of life stories,
presented both as little pop songs, and chamber epics. It even has his biggest
UK hit in “National Express” which is a terrific little track. There isn’t
really a weak point here either. Top class. [<em>Memory</em>: I discoverd and
absorbed all of his records in two relatively short periods of time. This one
was something that I spent a lot of time with towards the end of my first
window of obsession. Why I stopped with this terrific record I am not sure.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Electro-Shock Blues</em> by <strong>Eels</strong> - A very sad record that manages to not be
terribly depressing. I think it is because it is a story of managing how one
deals with bad things happening and the path to a brighter place. Still his
finest work. [<em>Memory</em>: I had been looking for a vinyl copy of this for years,
when I finally found one that I could import from Germany at a good price in
early 2023.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Is This Desire?</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - A transitionary work and a great one.
This was the pivot in her catalog from the aggression of the early records to
a more subtle and diverse approach that continues to this day. We still have
some of the growling early Polly Jean here, but the gentler more mature voice
becomes the dominant sound as things progress. [<em>Memory</em>: I didn’t really get
into her music until the more folk inspired records of the 2000s, but when I
took a look at the back catalog, this was my clear favorite from the more pure
rock era of her career.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hooray For Tuesday</em> by <strong>The Minders</strong> - A pure pop classic from the E6
folks. As much a triumph of Robert Schneider’s production as the musicians
writing and playing the music. It always feels like <strong>Dr. Dog</strong> and a bunch of
other pop-revivalists are continuously trying to make a version of this record
and falling short. “Comfortably Tucked Up Inside” is  remarkable song.
[<em>Memory</em>: This is an album that was always on the best of E6 lists that I was
consulting around 2006-07, but was much more difficult to source. There was
eventually a CD reissue that allowed me to experience this gem.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Big Calm</em> by <strong>Morcheeba</strong> - In its final form, trip-hop started to take on
qualities similar to vocal jazz. This is the definitive record of the form.
That lounge scene on the cover definitely captures the general mood here.
[<em>Memory</em>: Other record that I burned from my friend at my job at the time. I
found a lot of favorites that way evidently.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</em> by <strong>Neutral Milk Hotel</strong> - I find both the
ridiculously high praise this album got the the early 2000s, and the backlash
it is experiencing in the early 2020s to both be a bit absurd. This is a
humble little lowfi psych pop record, no more, no less. Admittedly it is a
very good one, but the extremely high and low opinions expressed in thought
pieces published over the last 20 years, make me thing that I am missing
something or everyone else is. [<em>Memory</em>: I didn’t really connect with this
one until I listened to it on a run around a cinder track at my Junior High
School on a trip back to my hometown around 2010.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Aquemeni</em> by <strong>Outkast</strong> - Their last album that is still a clear product of
the rap sounds of that time. After this they would completely go off the map.
That said, this is one of the best records in late 90s rap, and the entire
genre’s history. If it wasn’t for some nonsense filler interludes, this might
be perfection. [<em>Memory</em>: It is hard to listen to this record and not think
about driving to and from State College, PA. I listened to this on my portable
CD player on many of those trips.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Yield</em> by <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> - This was where they were starting to become better
at ballads like “Wishlist” and gentle rockers like “Given to Fly” than the
uptempo rockers of their youth. Though this record does contain “Push Me, Pull
Me” which is one of the more underrated rock songs in their catalog.
[<em>Memory</em>: My co-worker bought this album and played it repeatedly after it
came out. Over time it completely reversed my opinion of their late 90s output
and would trigger my era of peak interest in the band.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>XO</em> by <strong>Elliot Smith</strong> - A master of smartly written pop gems, on this
record, he finally had the production values to really put everything
together. One of those records that I always forget how amazing it is until I
put it on. [<em>Memory</em>: This was one of the first records that I remember
listening to on my brand new iPod Nano in 2005.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trading with the Enemy</em> by <strong>Tuatara</strong> - Somewhat of an indie super-group who
specialized in world music influence jazz fusion. The kind of thing that could
only happen in the 90s. They produced exactly this one great record, with the
rest of their catalog sorely lacking. [<em>Memory</em>: Yet another find from the
CD-R exchange at work. This was how I found music after commercial radio and
before the rise of the MP3.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Great Expectations (Soundtrack)</em> by <strong>Various Artists</strong> - The last of the
great compilation soundtracks in my opinion. They really don’t make them like
this anymore. At the time it was a curiosity as the solo debut of both <strong>Chris
Cornell</strong> and <strong>Scott Weiland</strong>. It also served as a mid-career reboot for
<strong>Tori Amos</strong> who took her singer songwriting to a more complex and upbeat
place that would anticipate her next few records. Sprinkle in some light
French electronica from <strong>Mono</strong> and we have a late 90s gem, and a great
farewell to an album format that was huge in the 80s/90s. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought
this record on the way back from a scholarship interview in Philadelphia. I
made a targeted trip to the Coventry Mall based exclusively upon the music I
heard in the trailer for the film. It turned out to be a fantastic record and
my point of entry to one of my favorite artists, <strong>Tori Amos</strong>]</p></li>

<h2>1999<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I guess if this project had a very beginning it would be this year. Sometime in
early 2000 I would assemble a mix CD of what I considered to be the best songs
of the prior year. I had recently bought my first CD burner, and one application
I was very excited about was the ability to create compilations that I could
listen to on the Sony Discman that was hooked into a casette adapter in my car.
It was a highly manual process that required me to insert and remove twelve
different albums as each track was added to the CD-R. So what was on
this disc, and how does it hold up 23 years later?</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/best_of_1999.jpg"><img alt="Old best of 1999 mix CD" src="../_images/best_of_1999.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>It could be way worse! Nine of the sixteen tracks come off of five albums that
are still among my favorites from the year. A further four songs make the list
of my favorite tracks off of records that are not on my album list. That means
that only three tracks have dropped off my radar completely, and they are a
study in how my taste has changed over time.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“No Leaf Clover” by <strong>Metallica</strong> - I don’t know that any other band has aged
less gracefully than these guys. What used to seem so edgy and hard, now comes
across as tacky and commercial. At the time I liked this track enough for it
to kick off the whole comp, but today it feels dated and boring.</p></li>
<li><p>“Higher” by <strong>Creed</strong> - This isn’t awful by any means, and it probably still
ranks as one of their best songs. In general I have no taste for the post
grunge sound anymore. There are a few selections on the list below that are
adjacent to this kind of thing, but I just can’t take all those distorted
droning guitars anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Chemicals Between Us” by <strong>Bush</strong> - Listening to this song again, it is a
bit more interesting than I remember. The structure is fairly ambitious for a
late 90s alt rock song, and it seems to be alluding to break beats in its
rhythms. That said, this band suffers from a bad case of crappy 90s guy
vocalist.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t even own all the albums and had to borrow two of them from a friend to
complete the playlist. This revealed to me another use of the CD burner, piracy.
For the next several years I would use this means to expand my collection beyond
what my current wealth could achieve. It was the age of music piracy after-all.
I had been experimenting with MP3 downloads for the last year or so when
high-speed internet all of a sudden made them way more practical. I remember
sitting in the computer lab of Penn State Berks campus filling up a 100 MB zip
disk a couple dozen tracks from Napster. Looking back, I wasn’t really
interested in pirating music, I just wanted a sample top make informed
decisions. We were using Napster like we use Spotify today. Regardless, by 2003
legal music downloads were finally a thing and I went completely legit. It isn’t
true of everyone, but I think the download era made me into the music consumer I
am today. I own 4000+ albums in different formats after-all.</p>
<p>Why was 1999 the first year when I decided to make a summing up of my favorites?
This was the dawn of the internet age, and there were a couple hand-crafted
websites out there already doing the same thing that surely were an
inspiration. For me though, it was something deeper. In late 1998 I had moved
out of my parents house. My summer internship was providing me a small amount of
discretionary income, and my discretion was to buy music. Specifically it was my
discretion to buy the music that interested me, all the music that interested
me for the first time in my life. Growing up in a conservative religious cult,
large swaths of pop music were considered evil, the work of “the Devil”. I was
mentally out of that mindset for some years, but the physical separation gave me
the freedom to explore my genuine self. Nowhere was this more tangibly evident
than the music I was consuming. Is this why pop music is so important to me? Because
in many ways it was the first medium through which I expressed and explored my
genuine self? I’m glad that so many of my favorites from that time are still
something I enjoy today. They have however been joined by quite a few others.</p>

<li><p><em>To Venus and Back</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - Her last album of the 90s and the end
of a period of massive artistic growth. It’s not that Tori has stopped
innovating after this one, but the rate of growing ambition slowed down a bit.
The originals on disc 1 take the electronic infused sounds from <em>Choirgirl</em> to
their logical and fulfilling conclusion. Some of the most exciting deep tracks
that still show up at live shows are here, like “Josephine”, “Suede”, and
especially “Lust”. The closing track “1000 Oceans” seems to point towards the
more straight ahead singer-songwriter material that would feature on the next
few records. Disc 2 is a stunning capture of Tori at her live best. At the
time it felt a little unnecessary, but today I’m glad we have this record of
the earliest days of full band Tori Amos performance practice. [<em>Memory</em>: This
is the first of three records on this list that came out the same exact day:
September 21, 1999. I’ll never forget heading to the Best Buy by my college
with a list of records to pick up. I was particularly interested in this one
as I had been buying the CD singles that had been released in advance of this
record. Each one seemed to be better than the one that came before. I remember
leaving the Wyomissing Boarders with a CD single of “1000 Oceans” and having
it unwrapped and ready to go in the discman by the time I got to my car. The
album did not disappoint. Soon after Tori would go on her dual headlining tour
with Alanis. I remember discussing with one of my work colleagues a plan to
somehow split the ticket to the Philly show, since we each only cared about
one of the artists.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>When the Pawn…</em> by <strong>Fiona Apple</strong> - Still my favorite record by her. The
eccentricity that would define her later work is starting to form, but has yet
to become grating. Certainly not a commercial record by any means, and it
pretty much destroyed her career for almost two decades. [<em>Memory</em>: This is
one of those records that I assumed that I would never own on vinyl. Thanks to
the success of <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em> we got a really nice repress on Vinyl
Me Please in 2021. It cracks me up that they left the pretentiously long title
off the cover this time. I have to assume she is mildly embarrassed about that
as an adult.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Euphoria Morning</em> by <strong>Chris Cornell</strong> - A bit of a lost classic. After the
horrors of <strong>Audioslave</strong> and his later solo career it can be easy to forget
about this nice little 60s rock inspired record. In the late 90s it seemed
like every aging alt-rocker was leaning heavily on the psych-rock of their
youth. This was a nice showcase of his voice in a set of more low key
material. If only we had gotten more of this. [<em>Memory</em>: The second record on
this list from 21 September 1999. I was a fan of <strong>Soundgarden</strong> and enjoyed
his contribution to the <strong>Great Expectations Soundtrack</strong> and was very
interested in what his solo career would hold. I was very pleased with this
disc and the solo show I caught later in 1999 at the Tower Theater. After
that, I can’t say I enjoyed his work.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Implode</em> by <strong>Front Line Assembly</strong> - The beginning of their second phase.
Elements of techno and other modern electronic music are really starting to
creep in. This is massively danceable. The world music sounds of their other
act <strong>Delerium</strong> are also showing up more often. As an adult this is probably
my favorite of theirs. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought this on a bit of a whim during a
period of high interest in the <strong>Delerium</strong> project. In many ways, this was my
point of entry to the goth sounds.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Slow Riot for Zero Kanada</em> by <strong>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</strong> - Very much in
the sound of their debut LP, this EP is the perfect fit for when you want just
a taste of the <strong>Godspeed</strong>. Yeah it all sounds very much the same in
retrospect, but I like that sound. [<em>Memory</em>: IN 2021, when I was chasing down my
favorites from the past to make my vinyl collection as complete as I could, I
waffled on how much I really needed this. It ended up being the last record I
bought during that project.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The 3 Way</em> by <strong>Lilys</strong> - An interesting band that did a bunch of different
things, and released a ton of albums very quickly. I sought them all out, but
my favorite will always be this <strong>Kinks</strong> homage. The way that it fuses the
sounds from those late 60s records with the spirit of 90s indie is a magic
combination. [<em>Memory</em>: This was fairly obscure when I became aware of it in
the mid-2000s. I remember buying a used copy off of Amazon that didn’t even
have the front cover booklet. I now own an amazing 2019 vinyl pressing that I
am amazed got made.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Christmas</em> by <strong>Low</strong> - A remarkable holiday album that feels like an
incredibly natural thing for this band to create. It is warm and sad, and
complicated. It really captures the feeling of the holiday season for me and a
lot of other folks who consider it their seasonal favorite. [<em>Memory</em>: Around
2019 I started to compile a playlist of holiday music that captured the way
the season felt to me. I discovered this record when researching potential
candidates to add.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Secret Name</em> by <strong>Low</strong> - I don’t know that any other album lives up to the
genre of “slowcore” quite like this one. Beautiful music that moves along a
glacial pace. They hadn’t yet mastered their vocal harmonies (that would come
on the next one) but this has a delightful smallness they would never have
again. [<em>Memory</em>: I was listening to this a lot when I moved into the first
apartment I lived in alone. Everything was so quiet, and it felt a bit lonely.
This music really fit with that.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Play</em> by <strong>Moby</strong> - This guy was everywhere in the late 90s. This guy “is”
the late 90s. He might not be in fashion anymore, and actually is a bit hated
today, but this is still some really enjoyable pop-electronica. In fact, with
its break-beats, world music sounds, and epic production values, this might
sound more like the late 90s than anything else out there. [<em>Memory</em>: In the
summer of 1999 I took a trip to Niagara Falls with my brother, sister, and a
high school friend. As we waiting in traffic to get back to the hotel after a
fireworks show, I heard two songs I didn’t know on Edge102. They struck me so
much that I would start an email exchange with the station to find out what
they were. I would only have to wait a matter of days to find one of them
“Porcelain” from this record, when one of my coworkers brought it in and was
listening to it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>California</em> by <strong>Mr. Bungle</strong> - The last a best record from these guys. Their
throw everything at the wall approach didn’t generally create cohesive albums
that were enjoyable from beginning to end, but this one is. Heavy on the
doo-wap and surf rock genres, it also throws in bits of metal, noise and
rockabilly. The high points are the eclectic opener “Sweet Charity” and the
sweet pop of “Retrovertigo”. [<em>Memory</em>: Another record that makes me think of
the apartment I lived in by myself around 2005-07. This was my peak era for
listening to things that were highly rated on RateYourMusic.com. I think this
was one of the last CDs I ever bough from the Columbia House music club.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Fragile</em> by <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> - It is wild to think how big of a
production a hard rock record could be in the late 90s. We still have massive
overproduced albums, but they are by mainstream pop artists now, not outsider
electro-industrial outfits. This is one of those double albums that delivers
on its promise. You get the sense that Trent is no longer as lost or angry as
he is posturing to be, but man this is compelling stuff. The song “Please” is
an all time classic blistering NIN track, but once again many of the best
moments are quieter like the title track, “I’m Looking Forward to Joining You,
Finally”, and especially “The Great Below”. His finest work, and a top 5 all
time record for me. [<em>Memory</em>: This is the third of the records to come out
on 21 September 1999 to make my list. I actually didn’t buy this one on the
day of release, as I only had so much money to throw around. One of my good
friends did buy it, and put it on at a house party that weekend. I can
remember clearly listening to it on a boom box on the kitchen table and being
blown away. I ran out and got my own copy.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Gay Parade</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong>  - [<strong>1999 FAVORITE</strong>] - I really miss the
early incarnation of Kevin Barnes making weird little psych pop gems. This is
the peak of that sound, and a subtly profound mediation on the nature of
happiness. The Songs that close out the albums are especially profound. “My
Friend Will Be Me” is about finding the inner strength to fight back the
darkness of loneliness. “My Favorite Boxer” a set piece exploring the dangers
of finding fulfillment and meaning in a “relationship” with a media figure.
The cynical “Advice From a Divorced Gentleman to His Bachelor Friend
Considering Marriage” calls out the draining trap of negative thinking. The
stunningly beautiful “A Man’s Life Flashing Before His Eyes While He and His
Wife Drive Off a Cliff into the Ocean” shows how we often only realize how
good we have it when we are faced with it all being taken away. Then we have
“Nickee Coco and the Invisible Tree” who’s message is complex and completely
unclear. A young girl who becomes separated from her community seems to find a
place of peace and calm. Should we feel good when Nickee is found, or did she
really belong in that tree? [<em>Memory</em>: This was the first album I ever spent a
little more for a used copy of. For several months I watched eBay and
eventually put down $35 plus shipping for my own copy of the 1999 pressing. It
is funny to think about that as a lot of money now, since that is pretty much
the going rate for new albums. I remember a group of us were listening to
records on my old crappy Sony turntable in the basement game room of my
apartment in those days, and I dropped the disc on the floor! It survived.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Black Foliage Animation Music: Volume I</em> by <strong>The Olivia Tremor Control</strong> -
My favorite of the albums by the core Elephant6 bands. A fascinating, dark
sound collage, this is music of a particular mood. It makes very little sense
in daylight, or overly happy times. They only released two records, but they
were one of the greatest bands of the 90s. [<em>Memory</em>: I listened to this a lot
during the period where I was moving to Rochester around 2008/09. I remember
jamming it in a mostly empty office while I worked late into the night. It was
perfect for that environment. In 2010 the E6 bands played a holiday show in
Buffalo, and I enjoyed getting to hear several of my favorites off of this,
including the amazing “I Have Been Floated”.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Terror Twilight</em> by <strong>Pavement</strong> - For their last statement, they did
something a bit more refined, but not that refined. Given the change in
direction it isn’t surprising this was the end. A strong collection of songs
from one of the defining groups of the decade, and a blueprint that many of
the 2000s indie bands would mine for content. [<em>Memory</em>: I actually didn’t
know very much about this one when Matador released the vinyl reissues in
2010. I bought it to complete the set, and I’m glad I did.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Stupid Dream</em> by <strong>Porcupine Tree</strong> - The definitive statement of their mid
period, alt rock days. Some really interesting long-form rock songs with light
prog elements. The focus here was definitely the song-writing, and we got some
standouts, especially “Piano Lessons” and “Stop Swimming”. Mostly somber and
reflective in tone, this isn’t happy music, but it isn’t depressing.
[<em>Memory</em>: They were still and unknown band in the states when this came out,
and I only knew about it because of one of my friends from work who got it
from a friend back in his native Poland. I burned a CD-R off of him, and that
was my copy until I got the first official US release in the mid-aughts.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Home</em> by <strong>Sevendust</strong> - I listened to a lot of this kind of NuMetal thing
back in the day, but most of it hasn’t held up. The reason I keep coming back
to this is the vocals are a step above anything else in the genre. In addition
to the usual growling we have some really pretty <strong>Deftones</strong>-esque vocal
harmonies. This shows that a much maligned genre could be better. [<em>Memory</em>:
Every time I see that this album is on my list of favorites I question that
and think that it can’t be true. Then I listen to it, and realize that yeah, I
do actually like it quite a bit.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Agaetis Byrjun</em> by <strong>Sigur Ros</strong> - Ethereal beauty is the cliche way to
describe this one, but it is accurate. They feel like they have spent the rest
of their career trying to recapture this sound, and as a result have pretty
much kept duplicating this record. A dreamy atmospheric record for a winters
day. [<em>Memory</em>: I discovered this during a CD-R swap at my summer job in 2002.
I didn’t listen to it until I was back at my college apartment for the next
year, and I can still picture sitting in my basement room, listening on my PC
completely blown away by what I was hearing.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dysfunction</em> by <strong>Staind</strong> - Wow, what a time capsule of what music sounded
like back then. The rumbling low tunings, the growling. Oh yeah, this is
dated, and I have no idea why I am still listening to it almost 25 year later,
but I am. [<em>Memory</em>: I don’t believe in the concept of guilty pleasures, but
this one pushes that boundary. I thought long and hard about whether I could
put this on the list, but here we are.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>No. 4</em> by <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong> - A remarkable record that includes some
of the better grunge tunes these guys ever made (especially “Down”) while
continuing their development into more subtle territory with pop songs like
“Sour Girl” and “I Got You”. I don’t think these guys were appreciated in
their time, and this album really shows off their range. [<em>Memory</em>: This
album really makes me think of the Penn State Berks Campus that I attended
from 1998-2000. I was listening to this a lot on my rides into school.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Apple Venus Volume 1</em> by <strong>XTC</strong> - A truly exceptional record that feels like
the culmination of the 20+ year journey by these guys. A collection of ornate
pop gems, its not surprising they decided to stop here. This might the best
this kind of chamber pop can be done. Andy Partridge was writing 10 great
songs before breakfast in those days, and even Colin Moulding came up with his
ultimate statement in the stunner “Frivolous Tonight”. [<em>Memory</em>: When I
started to really get into these guys around 2005, this album had already
almost reached mythical status. Shortly thereafter I was able to actually buy
a copy when the <em>Apple Box</em> set was released.]</p></li>
