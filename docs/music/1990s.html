<h2>1990s Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#s-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Maybe the most diverse and unique decade I will catalog in this project. When it
started, the prevailing trends were mostly a carryover of the dominant sounds of
the 80s. Then grunge and the alternative rock movement took hold. The influences
of world music and multiculturalism were undeniable. Rap/Hip-hop emerged from
the underground and became the dominant cultural force. Then it morphed with
R&amp;B and Rock to create new genres that would spawn the most popular groups of
the later half of the decade. Throughout all the trends, women were increasingly
taking the lead in driving trends and record sales. It was an exciting and
positive time, yet in many ways it was the end of the world as we knew it. By
the end of the decade, the music industry would be transformed by a series of
technological developments and we would never consume music the same way again.</p>
<p>These were my teenage years, and like any good teenager, I was a music
obsessive. I spent the early years very much looking backward into the artists
of the classic rock period. As things continued, I became very wrapped up in the
diverse sounds of the age. There was a lot going on over the course of these ten
years and this section took a long time to write. It was an enjoyable and
nostalgic journey, and I’m glad I could write these memories down while I can
still recall them clearly.</p>

<h2>1990<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first year of the 90s almost feels like an alternate potential future for
pop music. While most of these albums are a natural extension of the 80s sounds,
you can sense that the artists wanted to go to a bigger, new place for the new
decade. That said, we aren’t really seeing the roots of what would actually be
the predominant trends of the decade. So to me, 1990 is almost like an extreme
version of the 80s that hints at a different direction that pop could have gone.
Maybe my perception is colored by the list of artists that made my my favorite
work from the year. Each one of these musicians/groups rose to fame in the 80s
and is transitioning into the new decade, in most cases with an obvious attempt
to modernize or revitalize their sound. The only one of these records I heard at
the time would have been the <strong>George Michael</strong> album. I was not a fan back
then.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/1990.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1990" src="../_images/1990.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/61022tyA2oEFner1RR1gIL?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Gold Afternoon Fix</em> by <strong>The Church</strong> - After the breakout success of
<em>Starfish</em> they comfortably retreat back into cult-indie status in the new
decade. There are very few bands who have hovered under the radar for decades
more successfully than these guys. Not quite goth, not quite psychedelic
music, they are a genre unto themselves. It starts to sound a little too samey
to me on the albums after this, and this is their last compelling full album
statement for me. [<em>Memory</em>: Like so many people, I found these guys via the
film Donnie Darko. Unlike most people, I started my journey here, because it
was what I could buy on eMusic for a couple bucks.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Heaven or Las Vegas</em> by <strong>Cocteau Twins</strong> - 4AD would start to morph into
something else after the 80s wrapped, but we get one more record in the
classic sound of that massively influential label. This is quite a bit
brighter and slightly more accessible that their 80s work, but this is still
the kind of atmospheric, inventive dream pop these guys had been making since
the late 70s. This is one of those cases where a group was destroyed by their
eventually mainstream acceptance. In many ways, so was the label they were
signed to. [<em>Memory</em>: It always confused me how difficult it was to buy a
vinyl copy of this since it was successful in the era when people were still
buying that format. Their much more obscure early records were far more
widespread in both original and reissue form.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Violator</em> by <strong>Depeche Mode</strong> - Their massive hit, and for most people, their
definitive album. It adds a harder industrial edge to their existing synthpop
formula. It does feel like a blueprint for how an 80s electronic band could
transition to the brave new world of the 90s. Martin Gore doesn’t get enough
credit for how good he is at writing ballads, and “Waiting for the Night” is
one of his greatest works. [<em>Memory</em>: I was so into these guys in the late 90s
MP3 era. I probably downloaded most of this record off of Napster back in the
day. I don’t think I actually bought at copy until maybe 2010.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1</em> by <strong>George Michael</strong> - [<strong>1991 FAVORITE</strong>]
- This is such a brave departure, but it also manages to summarize the
essential qualities that made him a global pop superstar. At the time, I don’t
know that it was understood how central he was to the production of his solo
work, but this is a unique and spectacular recording. There is such a warm,
intimate sound here. The ballads like “Praying for Time”, “Cowboys and
Angels”, and “Mothers Pride” are probably the best work he ever put to record.
The lead single “Freedom! ‘90” is one of the songs that created the 90s.
[<em>Memory</em>: My opinion of this album has changed remarkably over my lifetime. I
remember when my sister bought it back then, I couldn’t stand it. Every time
that video for “Freedom” came on VH1, I changed the channel. By around 2007 I
was digging that single. By 2014 it was one of my favorite albums of all time.
By the time he passed in 2016, I fully understood and mourned the genius that
we had lost.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bona Drag</em> by <strong>Morrissey</strong> - In both his time with <strong>The Smiths</strong> and in his
solo career, there have been a preponderance of compilations. This collection
of early singles from his solo work is perhaps the most essential. It feels
like most of his finest moments from the first few years were littered among a
collection of singles and EPs. You could almost live with <em>The Best of
Morrissey</em> but then you wouldn’t have the outstanding “Piccadilly Palare” and
the essential “Will Never Marry”. [<em>Memory</em>: This was the compilation that
made me change my mind about including that kind of release on this list. So
many of my favorite songs would be left out in the cold if I didn’t include
this record.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Empire</em> by <strong>Queensryche</strong> - The pixelated logo on the front of the record
almost feels like a visual analogy for a quintessentially 80s metal band
consciously updating their sound for the new decade. It is a mostly successful
refresh that adds some electronics and slick production to create something
that is clearly trying to be a bit futuristic. They would never really recover
from loosing the edge they had on the earlier albums, and this is guilty of
trying to be a little too <strong>Pink Floyd</strong> at times. That said, their commercial
peak is a largely successful work that does a great job mixing radio friendly
power ballads with their trademark prog tendencies and complex guitar solos.
[<em>Memory</em>: I remember hearing “Silent Lucidity” on the radio, driving home
from class at the Penn State Berks campus. That ballad is a poor
representation of their work at large, but it would be my point of entry to
their outstanding catalog.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Vision Thing</em> by <strong>Sisters of Mercy</strong> - The brevity of their recorded output
has greatly enhanced their profile. Each of the three records is a a big shift
in scope and sound. This must have sounded incredibly fresh and exciting at
the time, and it really foreshadows the various electronic goth acts that
would emerge in the decade to come. I wish there were more albums, to see
where this was all leading, but maybe it saved us from the inevitable decline.
[<em>Memory</em>: I knew almost nothing about this record when I bought a MoFi
reissue of it for cheap. I was a massive fan of the first two, much more punk
rooted albums, and had heard very mixed reviews of this more electronic
affair. I loved it immediately.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Flood</em> by <strong>They Might be Giants</strong> - A transitionary work between their early
novelty song days, and the pop eclecticism that continues to our current day.
Jokey pop gem “Particle Man” would have fit right in on either of the first
two records. “Birdhouse in Your Soul”, perfectly balances their early and
later sound, and is one of the greatest pop songs ever written. Tracks like
“Sapphire Bullets of Pure Love” give the first indication of the experimental
pop we would see increasingly as their career developed. [<em>Memory</em>: Around
2010, YouTube was starting to become a massive repository of historical
footage and a profound source of nostalgia. One of the early videos I remember
watching, was a video of the group playing “Birdhouse” on the Carson show with
the Doc Severenson band (Doc played a blistering trumpet solo in the bridge).
It is still posted up there, and I’m glad that I can go back any time i want
and relive this very early 90s moment.]</p></li>

<h2>1991<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This will always been remembered as the year of grunge, and the first real shots
fired for the sounds of the new decade. With the exception of the debut by
<strong>Pearl Jam</strong>, my interest lie in different territory. I certainly remember the
video for “Smells Like Teen Spirit” constantly playing on MTV, but it didn’t
resonate with me then, and today I feel that it is a touch overrated because of
Kurt Cobain’s untimely death.</p>
<p>I was an elementary school student in 1991 who wasn’t really listening to the
music of the day. I was definitely a fan of the singles off of the <strong>R.E.M.</strong>
record and I believe that one of my siblings had a copy of that not long after
release. I definitely was very into the singles from the <strong>Genesis</strong> release,
but I wouldn’t hear the full album until I was in my mid 20s! It is strange to
think how different things were back in the era of physical media, when you
couldn’t instantly stream anything that interested you. Outside of the three
artists mentioned above, I can confidently say that I didn’t hear any of these
other records until the next millennium.</p>

<li><p><em>Everclear</em> by <strong>American Music Club</strong> - I have never listened any of the
other work by <strong>Mark Eitzel</strong>, but I really enjoy this mellow collection of
sad rock songs. I have to be in a certain mood to listen to something this
slow and dreary, but it is the finest work in this kind of genre. [<em>Memory</em>: I
came to this record via an exploration of the largely imaginary genre of
“Slowcore”. Very early in my vinyl collecting hobby I came across a LP of this
that I decided to pick up. I’m glad I did, as I have never seen it again
since.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Woodface</em> by <strong>Crowded House</strong> - These guys just make stunning pop songs.
Every time I put this record on, I am always shocked by how great these tracks
are. All their albums are worth listening to, but somehow this one is the best
summary of what makes them great, such that I don’t need the others? The
one-two punch of “Four Seasons In One Day” and “There Goes God” is made up of
two of my all time favorite songs. I really like <strong>Split Enz</strong> keeps popping
out in songs like ” Fame Is”. [<em>Memory</em>: around 2007 I became interested in
artists that were massively popular in other parts of the world, but less
known in the USA. While they are perceived as a one hit wonder here, they are
international superstars. While working through their catalog, this was always
the record that spoke to me the most.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>We Can’t Dance</em> by <strong>Genesis</strong> - This was the perfect end for this legendary
band, and I don’t know why they had to ruin things and release a sub-par
record with a different singer after this. We have the atmospheric pop-rock of
the 80s Genesis in songs like “No Son of Mine” and “Way of The World”. We have
sugary ballads that could have been solo <strong>Phil Collins</strong> gems like “Tell Me
Why” and “Hold on My Heart”. They once again reinvented themselves with a pair
of novelty tunes with videos that would run constantly on TV in “Jesus He
Knows Me” and especially “I Can’t Dance”. We even got two prog epics to
aknowlege where they started out. The historical drama of “Driving the Last
Spike” is an underrated gem that combines the prog bombast with the gentle
beauty of the Collins solo works. Then the slow build and closing grandeur of
“Fading Lights” creates perhaps the greatest “getting of the stage” moment a
group has ever made for itself. [<em>Memory</em>: In 2002-03 I bought most of the
Genesis albums. This was the last one that I acquired in that initial
exploration, and I remember listening to “Fading Lights” for the first time in
my rented room in Cleveland. It felt like such a final period to their career,
and it would be years before I sought out the early 80s albums that I didn’t
explore in my first tour through their catalog.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Blue Lines</em> by <strong>Massive Attack</strong> - This debut wasn’t quite as swampy and
atmospheric as what would come later. It also is the only record to feature
the one of a kind rapping by <strong>Tricky</strong>. They were a different group on this
one, in a way that I very much prefer. This is the sound of a collection of
artists creating a new sound that would eventually become trip-hop, but hadn’t
yet completely reached that form. The combination of electronics, break-beats,
rapping, and soul singing on “Safe From Harm” feels like a template for how to
make a great track in that genre. For me, it is the brilliant “Unfinished
Sympathy” with its combination of strings and electronics that is the finest
moment of their career. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember listening to this repeatedly
towards the end of my first summer in Cleveland working at the NASA Glenn
Research Center. I had purchased the record at one of the CD and Tape Exchange
locations, and would play it on my work PC while I worked on the thermal model
I was making that summer.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ten</em> by <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> - It is hard to get more 1991 than this. This briliant
record will always feel a little different from their other work. While it is
now seen as a major work in the dawn of grunge, there is something a bit 80s
about the production values that we would never see again. That said, from the
opening moment of Eddie’s lyrics on “Once”, this is very much a Pearl Jam
record. It just feels a little more arena ready than what would come later.
Anthemic tracks like “Evenflow”, “Alive”, and “Jeremy” would become a central
part of their live shows for decades to come. It is the dark epic “Black” that
is the high point for me, and a sound they they would really never do again.
This is one of those albums I sometimes underrate because of how ubiquitous it
has become, but this is stellar work. [<em>Memory</em>: I came to these guys a little
later than most men my age. It wasn’t until 1998 or so that I finally started
to listen to their 90s records. I started here, and for quite a while it was
the only record I had. It was so good, I assumed it was all I needed.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Out of Time</em> by <strong>R.E.M.</strong> - Always the innovators, R.E.M. were early
adopters of the eclecticism that would define the music of the 1990s. We have
early combination of rock and rap on “Radio Song” (which feels way more
successful today than it did then for some reason). We have a whole lot of
flirtations with alt-country throughout. This is where they started to go soft
for a bit with tracks like “Low”, “Half a World Away” and the massive hit
“Losing my Religion”. For the last time in a while we would get the tightly
constructed jangly, alt-rock that filled their 80s albums in songs like “Near
Wild Heaven” and “Texarkana”. [<em>Memory</em>: They were the only modern band I was
actually interested in at the dawn of the 90s. I certainly was aware of and
interested in this release. I had already listened to the prior album <em>Green</em>
extensively, and loved their back catalog via my exposure to the <em>Eponymous</em>
collection. Then there was the video for “Shiny Happy People” that featured
Kate Pierson (from one of my other favorites, <strong>The B-52s</strong>). The way my life
worked at 11, I would never dream of acquiring a rock album myself, so I
didn’t hear it until one of my siblings did acquire it later in the year. I
was onboard immediately, but my young ears were a bit confused by the rap
elements in the opening track. This record really takes me back to my younger
days when I hear it. I can imagine myself in the bedroom I shared with my
older brother, listening on his Kenwood hi-fi with the 6-CD clip changer. This
music is so fundamental to the taste I would develop.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Spiderland</em> by <strong>Slint</strong> - [<strong>1991 FAVORITE</strong>] - This has been my favorite
album for the better part of 20 years at this point. While it gets lumped in
with the ill-defined “post-rock” genre, this is far more crunchy and punk that
most of the music that gets put in that catch-all bin. So moody and
atmospheric, this mysterious band never made anything like this again. These
guys never really made anything else again. This is the adventurous sounds of
a band pushing the boundaries at a time in their life when they only partially
knew what they were doing. The album is so structurally and rhythmically
unique that you can always tell when someone is trying to imitate it, yet no
one has ever come close to replicating how this music feels. The combination
of spoken word and screamed vocals creates a harsh, claustrophobic atmosphere.
I can’t always listen to this, but when I can, it hits hard. This is the kind
of work that only makes sense in whole, and it demands a complete listen from
start to end. The greatest album of all time in my opinion. [<em>Memory</em>: I liked
this record from the moment I first heard it in 2006, but I wouldn’t recognize
it as my favorite of all time until two years later when I first listened to
my vinyl copy. I remember sitting in the dark in the living room of my
Woodycrest apartment with a glass of cognac watching the record spin, and for
the first time really engaging with the work in whole. I especially remember
the spare, clanging chords at the start of “Don,Aman” and fully appreciating
for the first time how important that moment is structurally to the impact of
the whole experience. The experience really drove home the role of physical
media for engagement, and the superiority of vinyl as my preferred format.
Every couple years I find myself pulling out one of my vinyl copies of this
record and having a similarly profound experience. It is an album so good, I
don’t want to ruin it by overindulging or bringing it out when I am not in a
place to fully engage with it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Laughing Stock</em> by <strong>Talk Talk</strong> - For what I generally consider to be an
imaginary, non-useful classification, the “post-rock” genre has two definitive
landmarks in 1991. Perhaps it is a useful label to describe music that
attempts to use the instrumentation and general spirit of rock music to create
atmospheric compositions that have more in common with more abstract artistic
expression. This is very much on the jazz influenced side of that catch-all
genre, and in fact is the definitive work of the sort. This builds directly
off of their preceding album, but goes to an even more impressionistic
territory. The songs make little sense in isolation but work together to
create a stunning whole. Such a pleasant yet unsettling record. It is always
interesting to think about what they would have done next had this
non-commercial work not destroyed their career. [<em>Memory</em>: This was another
record where vinyl really changed my perception. I had always far preferred
“Spirit of Eden” which was of the very first vinyl records I acquired, and
listened to predominantly on that format. This album was super rare and
expensive on vinyl, and it wasn’t until a reissue in 2011 that I would have
this as well. It wasn’t until I engaged with it in that whole form that I
fully appreciated how great this was as well.]</p></li>

<h2>1992<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I have mentioned multiple times, this project was done working backward from
the current day (in the 2020s) and I encounter major milestones in reverse. This
is the point where things become almost exclusively a retrospective discovery
process. Of the albums on my 1992 list, the only one I actually heard that year
was the one from <strong>R.E.M.</strong> and at the time I didn’t like it nearly as much as
their 1980s work that I was already a big fan of. As for the remainder, I heard
the singles from the <strong>Peter Gabriel</strong> and <strong>Sade</strong> records but they made little
impact on me at the time. This list would be assembled slowly over the last
three plus decades.</p>
<p>This year was very much a part of the “80s hangover” when most of the popular
music was being made by the dominant artists of the prior decade, but we are
also seeing the first indications of what the 90s would be. It was becoming
clear that more stripped back, acoustic sounds were going to dominate and that
women would play a far larger role in rock music. Some of the albums on my list
feel like a blueprint for how to make rock music in the 90s. I think it would
have been an exciting time to be following the trends closely, but alas, I was
just a kid.</p>

<li><p><em>Little Earthquakes</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - [<strong>1992 FAVORITE</strong>] - There is a lot
of discussion and disagreement about the artistic value of the body of work by
Myra Ellen [Tori] Amos, but few will try to say that this is anything less
than one of the greatest debut records ever made. This is the kind of album
that someone makes when they have been bursting with ideas since they were a
child, but only had the opportunity to put them to record properly at the age
of 28. Listening today, the most striking thing might be a kind of 70s/80s
singer-songwriter vibe on tracks like “Leather”, “China” and especially “Tear
in Your Hand” that we would never really hear from her again. Then there is
the blueprint for the kind of brilliant chamber pop that she has continued to
make on an off for decades since (“Crucify”, “Girl”, “Silent All These Years”,
“Mother”). We also see the first indications of the aggressive art-rock of her
mid-career in the outstanding “Precious Things”. Of course, there is also one
of the greatest songs of all time in the timeless classic “Winter”. [<em>Memory</em>:
It is impossible to pick just one memory to associate with this record, so I
will try to keep it to a few short paragraphs. In 1993 I became a massive fan
of the solo work of <strong>Paul McCartney</strong>. Around this time, I recorded a
documentary about his career of of VH1. It was a BBC program with different
timing from American cable TV, and they needed to show videos to fill out the
last half hour slot. They played the video to “Silent All These Years”. I
remember being confused and fascinated by the video with the red haired woman
spinning in a box in the white room. I remember thinking it was the latest
<strong>Cyndi Lauper</strong> song (LOL!).  I filed away the name Tori Amos, but didn’t dig
any further at the time. This would be the second of her records that I would
pickup in the summer of 1998. It would nearly instantly become one of my
all-time favorites. I remember trying to introduce my male friends to the
record, who thought I was crazy to be so excited to what they could only see
as “Lilith Fair Material”. I remember burning a CD of MP3 files that my
brother borrowed and played in the machine shop at work. It was a bit
embarrassing to have the song “Winter” associated with me in such a den of
conventional masculinity. I don’t know if any record makes me think more
strongly of my transition into young adulthood. These tracks remind me of my
first taste of real independence and the newfound opportunity to establish my
own personal identity. My relationship with the Tori Amos catalog has always
felt highly coupled with my rejection of the traditional definition of
masculinity.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tactical Neural Implant</em> by <strong>Front Line Assembly</strong> - The only one of their
early records that I really need at this point in my life. All the usual
elements are here: danceable electro-industrial beats, half-growled vocals,
and clips of classic science fiction films. For me, this is by far the most
successful iteration of the formula, and it renders a half dozen other albums
as redundant. [<em>Memory</em>: This reminds me of my first year living in State
College, PA. I had a tiny little room in shared college housing with three
other students who had transferred from the same Penn State satellite campus.
I wasn’t happy, and this record often fit well with my state of mind at the
time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Us</em> by <strong>Peter Gabriel</strong> -  The last of his “classic period” records feels
like it gets stronger and stronger as the years pass. Closer to its release
this felt a bit too much like <em>So</em>. Over time its themes of loss and change
give this depth that wasn’t evident to me immediately. The best moments are
the gentler songs like “Come Talk to Me”, “Blood of Eden”, and especially
“Washing of the Water”. Yes the singles “Steam” and “Digging in the Dirt” are
highly derivative of the hits from the preceding record, but in retrospect
they provide some nice textural variation to a record that should be
celebrated mostly for its quieter tracks. [<em>Memory</em>: The videos for the
singles on this album used the same kinds of stop motion tricks as those from
the album <em>So</em>. As a result of this apparent artistic stagnation, I didn’t
give this album a proper listen until much later. I think a lot of people made
this mistake at the time, and this never got its proper respect until the next
century.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dry</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - No one has mixed punk with the blues quite like Polly
Jean. “Oh My Lover” is one of the most striking career openers of all time.
One of the greatest rock vocalists arrives in full force on tracks like
“Dress”, “Sheela-Na-Gig”, and the closer “Water”. She would never make an
album this straightforward again, and over a dozen records later it still
feels absolutely essential. [<em>Memory</em>: It is interesting to realize that two
of my favorite artists of all time released their debuts in the same year. It
took me a while to make it to this record, as it was probably the very last
one that I connected with. It would take over 20 years after release for me to
really connect with the raw brilliance of this album.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Generation Terrorists</em> by <strong>Manic Street Preachers</strong> - It is fascinating in
retrospect how much this sounds like the contemporary hair metal. I can’t see
this as a work on the same level of what they would soon do, but heck if it
isn’t a fun, glammy affair. We also get a peak at the more substantial work to
come with the classic “Motorcycle Emptiness”. [<em>Memory</em>: perhaps the only
reason I consider this a minor classic is the fact that “Motorcycle Emptiness”
was one of the two songs (along with “A Design for Life”) that introduced me
to these guys during a Glastonbury highlight film on HDNet. Also, I am a
sucker for well done glam metal.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Your Arsenal</em> by <strong>Morrissey</strong> - The best work from his rockabilly era. The
best tracks are the eccentric, highly stylized ones like: “Glamorous Glue”,
“Certain People I Know”, and “I Know It’s Gonna Happen Someday”. The more
straightforward rockers like “We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful”
and the closer “Tomorrow”have held up better than most of his work of this
sort. Not among his very best records, but a very strong effort [<em>Memory</em>: I
greatly regretted not buying this when the vinyl releases were made around
2014. Everytime the man opens his mouth, the chance of later reissue series
decreases immensely. I tracked down a somewhat overpriced used copy on Discogs
in 2023.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Broken</em> by <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> - The most angry record by one of the angriest
artists ever. This kind of theatrics often sounds comical to me as a full
grown adult, but as a young person this felt different. That said, it is still
a fun listen, and an amazing production. Reznor has always been a master at
mixing the aggressive industrial noise with quieter moments. He probably did
that loud/quiet trick better here than on any other record. This is front
loaded, but those first two tracks (“Wish”, “Last”) are glorious. [<em>Memory</em>:
Throughout my adult life, sometimes even now when I am in a certain mood,
there is nothing I want to do more than listen to this at high volume on
headphones.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Slanted and Enchanted</em> by <strong>Pavement</strong> - I used to think that there music
became more refined as the years went by, but I now realize that it was mostly
a trick of production. On their first LP, the recording is compressed and
crunchy, sounding very much the early 90s indie classic it is. From a
songwriting and performance perspective they are already very much on top of
there very specific sound. There will never be another Pavement, and I will
never get tired of this album. [<em>Memory</em>: “Trigger Cut” has always been a
favorite of mine, and I was really excited to hear them play it during their
appearance at the 2010 Pitchfork Music Festival.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Automatic for the People</em> by <strong>R.E.M.</strong> - In the popular consciousness, this
is their finest work. Filled with ballads and acoustic sounds, this is a far
cry from their early punk influenced albums. The mellower tone does allow the
songwriting to come to the forefront, and I think that is why the masses
reacted to it so strongly. The best moments on this album are the quieter ones
like “Nightswimming” and the massive hit “Everybody Hurts”. It would be so
easy to write this off as a sellout record, and I’m glad that the world has
collectively decided to properly honor this as a classic record. [<em>Memory</em>: I
was already a huge fan of the band when this came out. My sister (and probably
everyone’s sister) bought this back in the day, and listed to it repeatedly. I
didn’t appreciate it at the time, and largely ignored it until I was in my
early 20s. I now fully understand and appreciate how it fits in with the
brilliant catalog of one of my favorite bands.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Down Colorful Hill</em> by <strong>Red House Painters</strong> - This is one of the most
beautiful albums ever made. A lot is made out of the artist’s life, and the
sadness of their situation when this was made. I prefer to think of it as the
story of someone realizing that they need to change, and taking the first
steps towards a better place. I don’t know that <strong>Mark Kozelek</strong> gets enough
credit for these understated, folk rock epics like “Medicine Bottle” and
“Down Colorful Hill”. It is a triumph of structure and composition that music
of this genre can produce 9-10 minute songs this compelling. [<em>Memory</em>: I
became really interested in the early work of this artist in the 2006-08
timeframe. This was a period of time when I was getting used to living on my
own for the first time in my life. There was something in the sounds and words
that really matched with how I felt in that point of my life. While I couldn’t
relate to the specific experiences, there was a general mood of isolation that
felt very familiar.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Love Deluxe</em> by <strong>Sade</strong> - The transition from 80s sophista-pop to 90s
downtempo and trip-hop felt natural and highly effective. This album was a
massive hit, where a group sensed the prevailing trends and capitalized on
them to great effect. I still prefer the more varied textures of the first
three records, but this is a very talented group of musicians taking their
sound to a fruitful new place. [<em>Memory</em>: The cover of this album makes me
think of Columbia House/BMG adds from the 90s. I feel like this was features
as one of the 10 albums you could get for a penny for most of the decade.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Core</em> by <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong> - This was their most straightforward rock
album, and perhaps the only time they were properly categorized as grunge.
That said, there are also the first indications of those Beatlesesque
melodies that would pop out more and more as the years went by. “Creep” and
“Plush” were everywhere in the early 90s, and in retrospect, they are stunning
examples of alt-rock tracks that were clearly aiming at the Billboard charts.
I’m glad that revisionist history continues to raise the profile of this band
that was underappreciated by critics in their time. [<em>Memory</em>: This reminds me
of middle school. This was the official band of boys my age. While I wasn’t
really allowed to listen to this kind of thing, I was kind of into them to.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>99.9 F Degrees</em> by <strong>Suzanne Vega</strong> - One of the best records you were going
to find in a used CD bin in the late 90s, this sold big, but was never really
appreciated by most who gave it a listen. This is very different from the
folk-pop she made in the previous decade, and added a lot of the sounds and
color of the contemporary alternative rock scene. At times it almost makes me
think of the twee (yet moody) alt-rock acts that would appear in the second
half of the decade (e.g. <strong>The Cardigans</strong>). This has aged really well!
[<em>Memory</em>: I remember a work colleague of mine who was also a big music person
often brought in CDs to share. I think he brought this one from his wife’s
collection due to my massive interest in the work of <strong>Tori Amos</strong> and <strong>Fiona
Apple</strong>. There is perhaps a bit of Fiona here, but in general this is also
brilliant work by a female artist, working in a fairly different territory
than my other favorites of the time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Nonesuch</em> by <strong>XTC</strong> - What a close to their original run! Their gradual
progression from angular punks to highly refined art pop is one of the most
compelling transformations in rock history. The songs here are absolutely
masterful, especially the all time classics “Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead” and
“The Disappointed”. This would have been an amazing end to their story, but we
would get two more brilliant albums at the turn of the millennium. [<em>Memory</em>:
For years this was one of those grail records for me. I used to assume that I
would never own this on vinyl, but a 2020 reissue would make my XTC collection
complete.]</p></li>

<h2>1993<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was the start of my teenage years, and for the first time I remember really
engaging with pop music, albeit the pop music of years gone by. I also remember
connecting with two of the records below, which were both by legacy artists.
Those artists, <strong>Billy Joel</strong> and <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> would play a key role in my
developing musical tastes, so much so that I feel like those artists deserve
attention in my footnotes to the 90s as some sort of origin story. The rest of
these albums would be discovered in the decades to come, and I even vividly
remember hating singles off of three of them in the year of release!</p>
<p>This is the conclusion of a period of transition between the 80s and the 90s,
and by the end of the year we were clearly in a new era. The grunge sound was
almost like a brief palette cleanser between the brighter, gaudier 80s and the
heart of the 1990s that would strive toward authenticity and diversity.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/1993.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1993" src="../_images/1993.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Modern LIfe is Rubbish</em> by <strong>Blur</strong> - This was back in the days when an
artist’s first album could be a limited success and they still get a second
crack at it. Blur made the best of the opportunity. Gone is the poorly
executed on shoegaze and jangle sounds, and their trademark quirky Britpop
whimsey takes over to great effect. The start of a classic five album
sequence. [<em>Memory</em>: When they did the Blur reissues in the 2012 timeframe, it
made me really think about which of the albums were truly among my favorites.
This was the first one I ran out and got. I remember being startled buy the
price at nearly 30 dollars. If I only knew how high prices would go.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Buddha of Suburbia</em> by <strong>David Bowie</strong> - Sometimes albums become legendary
mostly because of their obscurity. In the case of this one, it is because it
is both obscure and amazing. This is the return of the “real Bowie” after the
poor showings in the late 80s and the curious diversions of <strong>Tin Machine</strong>.
It is the clear superior of the two records he would release this year. The
soundtrack format seems like it has freed him to experiment with new jazz and
electronic sounds. This is where 90s Bowie started to come into form.
[<em>Memory</em>: I had known about this for years before I actually gave it a
listen. It would be the rise of streaming that would allow me to experience
what I had always heard described with glowing terms. Maybe not as amazing as
it was billed in its days as an obscurity, but pretty close!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>White Tie, Black Noise</em> by <strong>David Bowie</strong> - A transitionary work that sounds
like an artist who is trying to reinvent themselves, while trying to
reconnect with their prior commercial success. The opening track “The Wedding”
with its break-beats and electronic groove makes it clear this is a product of
the 90s, and is followed by “You’ve Been Around”, which sounds like it could
have been left off <em>Never Let Me Down</em>. Lead single “Jump They Say” and the
<strong>Walker Brothers</strong> cover “Night Flights” feel like the perfect fusion of 80s
and 90s Bowie. Not as universally successful of the records to come, but a
great return after almost a decade away from making good new music. [<em>Memory</em>:
I remember VH1 playing the “Jump They Say” video over and over in the summer
of ‘93. I really disliked the song at the time. I just wasn’t ready for my
favorite artist yet.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ultimate Alternative Wavers</em> by <strong>Built to Spill</strong> - They would later
specialize in smooth, pop tinged indie rock, but their first, far rougher
around the edges album will always be my favorite. Sounding a bit like a more
psychedelic version of <strong>Guided by Voices</strong> or perhaps a punkier <strong>Modest
Mouse</strong>, this is early 90s indie at its finest. [<em>Memory</em>: I had become
interested in this band via their later work as heard on satellite radio in
the mid-2000s. The only album I could find on eMusic was this early gem, and
it was even more to my taste.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>August and Everything After</em> by <strong>Counting Crows</strong> - This will never be
considered “cool” but it is a well put together and very enjoyable record. It
probably sounds more like 1993 than any other album out there. “Mr. Jones” has
perhaps worn out its welcome, but the slower moments like “Round Here”,
“Perfect Blue Buildings”, and especially “Sullivan Street” have aged pretty
darn well. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw these guys (with opener <strong>Sixpence and None the
Richer</strong> no less) at Messiah College in 2003. It was ten years after their
high water mark, and they already felt like a legacy act. It was a pretty
great show that made me realize I liked these guys more that I tended to
admit. This album was one of the last I added to the list, and it was one of
the last that I realized I wanted on vinyl. It will never be “cool” to like
this album, and I need to get over that.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Everybody Else is Doing it, So Why Can’t We?</em> by <strong>The Cranberries</strong> - I love
the way this record sounds. It has the jangly, reverb heavy atmospherics of
the great 4AD releases, stunningly beautiful vocal overdubs, and an
unmistakably Irish soul that adds up to one of the finest productions of all
time. The songs are very strong too, and this is one of the finest debuts of
all time. [<em>Memory</em>: I wasn’t ready for this when it came out. I remember
making fun of the album when my sister listened to it back then, particularly
the song “Linger”. 30 years later I like few albums more.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Into the Labyrinth</em> by <strong>Dead Can Dance</strong> - At times this one gets “gothy”
to the point where it risks self-parody, but it manages to hold things
together. At the close of their first decade they are dialing everything up to
11 and we are seeing lots of the world music influences that infiltrated this
kind of music in the mid-90s. After this they would head in a direction with
far less of their early darkwave sound, and I wouldn’t follow. [<em>Memory</em>: In
the late 90s and early 2000s I was very into the band <strong>Delerium</strong> and sought
out related acts that I found listed in an AllMusicGuide genre page. I bought
a used CD of this album during one of my tours of Cleveland area CD Exchange
locations in 2003. In the years ahead I would work backward into their 80s
albums to find one of my favorite acts.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Songs of Faith and Devotion</em> by <strong>Depeche Mode</strong> - I am one of the view
people in the world who strongly prefers this follow-up to the classic
<strong>Violator</strong> that preceded it. I think it is the stronger, more hard-edged
electro-industrial edge on songs like “I Feel You” and “Rush” that make this
the better record for me. Yet, we also still have the best elements of the
synthop heavy, 80s <strong>DM</strong> on tracks particularly “Mercy in You”. Of course, we
also have an outstanding tender moment with Martin Gore on “One Caress”. This
is the peak of their 90s work for me. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember buying a CD of
this at the Reading Boarders in the 1999-2000 time-frame. My parents were very
concerned about the record based on the cover and title. I remember one of my
sisters friends convincing them that it was wholesome, legacy act. In
retrospect, my parents probably wouldn’t have been OK with the content of this
album. I am in debt to that person for helping me get access to this amazing
record.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Liberation</em> by <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> - The official start for this guy, and a
solid collection of chamber pop songs out of the gate. While there is a bit
more filler here than what we would come to expect, the high points are among
Neil Hannon’s finest work, especially “Your Daddy’s Car” and “Queen of the
South”. This would be the last time we would hear the comic new wave of tracks
of “Europop” until 2019’s <em>Office Politics</em>. [<em>Memory</em>: This was one of the
albums by Hannon that I didn’t fully appreciate until the vinyl reissues came
out in 2020. I’m so glad I bought them all. They are all great records.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Duran Duran (The Wedding Album)</em> by <strong>Duran Duran</strong> - The first of several
times these guys have re-invented themselves and seemingly returned from the
dead. In retrospect this isn’t as significant of a change as it seemed. The
opener “Too Much Information” is almost like a song from <em>Rio</em> with some
accoustic guitar overdubs and crunchy 90s drums. The big hits, particularly
the massive “Ordinary World” was a more significant diversion to a very 1990s
kind of eclecticism, but still  <strong>Duran Duran</strong>. This is where they proved
that they were true pop geniuses that would stand the test of time. [<em>Memory</em>:
At the time, I was very disappointed by this album, particularly “Come Undone”
which I despised seeing on MTV and VH1. I was already a huge fan of their 80s
work, and this wasn’t doing it for me. Somehow I didn’t recognize that
“Ordinary World”, which I enjoyed quite a bit, was by them. In the late 90s,
my sister gave me her copy of this and after reconsideration it became an
all-time favorite of mine. This is the album that I want most on vinyl.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rid of Me</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - The first signs of exactly how eclectic her
career was going to be. There are elements of the bluesy punk rock we saw on
<em>Dry</em>, but there are so many other things going on here, from chamber rock to
screaming art-punk. This will never stop being a challenging, rewarding
listen. [<em>Memory</em>: Very early in the vinyl revival (circa 2007) there was a
teased reissue of this that never ended up being made. I remember asking Greg
at City Lights to keep an eye out for me, and he halfheartedly tried to get a
copy. We wouldn’t see this re-issue arrive until the comprehensive repress
campaign in 2017.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>River of Dreams</em> by <strong>Billy Joel</strong> - There is something to be said for
knowing when to call it quits. This doesn’t all work, but it is still a strong
record from an artist who realized they didn’t have another one in them. Of
course, at the time of this writing 30+ years later, he is still touring this
material and what came before. It is a fascinating decision for the artist to
draw a line and say I am done creating. It is also interesting to realize that
with songs like “No Man’s Land” and “Shades of Grey”, the artist is still
trying to work out the New Wave sounds of the 1980s. The title track is
without question an attempt to tap into the multicultural, eclecticism of the
contemporary scene. A master imitator, the final work by William H Joel makes
a strong case for his position as the Irving Berlin of the late 20th century.
The fact that the last song “Famous Last Words” unambiguously establishes this
as the capstone of his songwriting gives his career a kind of conceptual unity
that even someone like <strong>David Bowie</strong> can’t claim to. [<em>Memory</em>: I was a
massive fan of his work around this time in my life. I remember my brother
telling me that he had heard a new Billy Joel song playing when he was at the
car wash, and I listened to the radio constantly until I heard it as well. I
remember my cousin (also a big fan) delivering me a copy of the album
unprompted on the day of release. In many ways, this was the moment when I
fully engaged with the excitement of pop music. All my explorations from the
<strong>Beatles</strong> to <strong>King Crimson</strong> to even <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> have in some way
been branching outward from this release.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Off the Ground</em> by <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> - This album is the best demonstration
of the strengths and weaknesses of one of the all time greats. The lyrics and
themes are often too obvious (“Looking for Changes”) and sometimes downright
hokey (“Biker Like an Icon”), but the melodies are consistently interesting
and stunningly beautiful (pretty much the whole thing, but holy moly “Hope of
Deliverance” is masterful). The sounds of comfortable middle age, Linda’s
illness and death would be the unfortunate perturbation towards more
meaningful themes in the records to come. [<em>Memory</em>: This album was a big part
of my summer of 1993. I have happy memories of listening to this (right after
the hits compilation <em>All The Best</em> which was in the same CD clip) while I
played Super Mario All-Stars on the SNES. I remember jamming the mildly
psychedelic hidden track “Cosmically Conscious” on my sisters boombox through
some old walkman headphones. I remember seeking out the CD single to finally
hear the full version of that mysterious track. I remember writing an analysis
of the cheesy lyrics to “Peace In the Neighborhood” in middle school English
class. This isn’t a perfect album, but there are so many larval elements of
the kinds of music I would favor as my tastes developed. It took a while for
me to aknowlege this in adulthood as one of my favorites, but there is no
question this is a fundamental influence on my listening. In 2025 I imported a
vinyl copy of this from Columbia, with full confidence there will never be a
reissue. I have a deep relationship with this album that few people do.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fumbling Towards Ecstasy</em> by <strong>Sarah McLachlan</strong> - The founder of Lilith Fair
peaked here, and on some level, would never reach these heights
again. A delightful combination of folk, rock guitars, and electronics, it
manages to find the optimal place between smoothness and musical interest.
“Possession” will always be among my very favorite songs. [<em>Memory</em>: It is
hard to think of VH1 in the early 90s without thinking about the song
“Possession” which was on there nearly non-stop.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>II (The Brown Album)</em> by <strong>Orbital</strong> - Along with <em>In Sides</em>, this is almost
all I need from these guys, and perhaps the whole genre of techno. It is a
case where the form was done so well, anything else just sounds not as good.
There is something that feels so futuristic and positive about the whole
record that also makes it quintessentially 1990s music. [<em>Memory</em>: It was hard
to get their music in the US in the early 2000s. For a long time, all I had
was a best of compilation that I found at a Cleveland area CD and Tape
Exchange. It wasn’t until I could import CDs using Amazon that I had access to
all the albums.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Vs.</em> by <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> - Their career has always had tension between polished
professionalism and rawer, more garage influences under the surface. While
their debut was dominated by the polish, this is where the rawness started to
show though more. Some fantastic rockers here like “Go”, “Animal”, and
“Blood”, but there are also some gentler, more folky songs like “Daughter”,
“Dissident”, and of course the legendary “Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in
a Small Town”. In many ways this is where they established the sound that
would dominate their work for decades to come. [<em>Memory</em>: In 1994, the
entirety of my middle school was ushered to the auditorium for an assembly.
The state was mostly covered with black fabric, with the exception of a square
projection screen, and mysterious electronic equipment was setup in the middle
of the seating. When the lights were turned down, a laser drew a cartoon of a
headbanging skateboarder while the sounds of “Go” blared in the auditorium.
For some reason the school administration decided to treat us to a laser light
show set to the hard rock tunes of the day. It was awesome!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Red House Painters (I)</em> by <strong>Red House Painters</strong> - [<strong>1993 FAVORITE</strong>] - A
lot has been written about the “beautiful sadness” captured in these songs,
and it is absolutely true. It perhaps makes it more palatable to know that the
artist is in a much better place now. That said, I don’t know that anything
captures quiet despair quite like the songs “Katy Song” or “Mother”. The
fuzzy, raw Albini like production really helps set the right mood. I have to
be in the right mood for this, but when I am… [<em>Memory</em>: While writing about
this record, I remembered a concert that I had forgot about. I saw Mark
Kozelek play the 2010 Noise Pop Festival in San Francisco, and I was really
upset that he played nothing from this record.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Siamese Dream</em> by <strong>Smashing Pumpkins</strong> - Is this the most 90s record ever
made? Those crunching guitars and ambiguously psychedelic production values
certainly make a strong case. I prefer the meandering experimentation of their
next album just a bit more, but “Today” might still be their absolute top
song. [<em>Memory</em>: Talk about a record that takes me back to middle school. I
wasn’t even that into them, but you just couldn’t avoid it. It was everywhere.
Everyone talks about rock being dead now, but I feel like rock certainly
hasn’t dominated the popular consciousness again, since it did with this
release.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The London Suede</em> by <strong>Suede</strong> - The more glammy Britpop acts are the missing
link between the 90s and the early 2000s indie sleaze era. Chief among them
are <strong>Pulp</strong> and these guys. There albums have always sounded kind of the same
to me, and this is all I need. “Metal Mickey” is an absolute highlight.
[<em>Memory</em>: When I went to london for the first time in 2007 I went to an HMV
with the express intent to buy music I couldn’t get back home. I came home
with the debut by <strong>Howling Bells</strong> and a singles compilation by this group. I
can’t imagine a more English record to come back with.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Early Years, Vol 2</em> by <strong>Tom Waits</strong> - I think it says something that the
only album I like by this guy is a compilation of work before his first
official release. I much prefer the straight ahead singer-songwriter material,
and I like it here even more than the records, without all the polish and
studio gloss. “Ol’55” is one of the greatest songs ever written, and this
spare acoustic performance is the definitive one. [<em>Memory</em>: My girlfriend
circa 2004 loaned me a stack of CDs. This was pretty much the only one I
really like from the whole lot, and it has stuck with me for the last few
decades, about 20 years longer than the relationship.]</p></li>

<h2>1994<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 1994 the local classic rock station that I frequented changed to a modern,
hard rock format. At first, I resisted the change and retreated into the CD
collections of my siblings. That station, WYSP, was also the broadcaster for my
beloved Philadelphia Eagles, and used the alternative rock of the station as
bumpers out to commercial breaks during games. Eventually I relented to the new
format and discovered a window to the music that my peers at school were
listening to. It was the last days of grunge, and a more diverse collection of
sounds were driving rock music. Some of the mid-90s hard rock that I was hearing
still makes my list of favorites below. Beyond rock music, there are quite a few
bits of 90s eclecticism on there as well. While I only knew about a quarter of
these albums in their year of release, this would be the peak of my pop music
awareness until my late teens.</p>
<p>Looking back, this was a particularly strong year for popular music. I think
this is where the positive eclecticism of the 90s really started to kick in, and
there was a wide range of sounds to listen to.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/1994.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1994" src="../_images/1994.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Under the Pink</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - Perhaps the most Tori Amos of the Tori
Amos records. A completely unique, iconoclastic collection of highly personal,
yet thematically ambiguous piano songs. The wide range of textures and moods
makes for a record that never gets old, even after hundreds of plays. While
the instrumentation and performances give a similar feel to her debut, the
arrangements and song structure take things to a more experimental level that
foreshadow the ambitious works to come. I think for much of the fan-base, this
is “the record”. While that isn’t true for me, it certainly is a record I will
keep coming back to. [<em>Memory</em>: This is another of those records that takes me
back to my freshman year in college, listening on my portable cd player
through a cassette adapter as I commuted in. There is a kind of excited,
warmth to this album. The sounds of someone who has lived a somewhat sheltered
life, and discovered the world a few years later than every one else. Or maybe
that was just me.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Parklife</em> by <strong>Blur</strong> - Every generation has a British band that is the most
British of the British bands. In the 90s, that was these guys, and this is
their most British album. I mean, there is a song based on the maritime
weather conditions broadcast. A lot of Britpop, is more rock than pop, but
this album really puts the pop to the forefront. [<em>Memory</em>: For many years I
tried to convince myself that this was not the best Blur record. I was wrong,
this is amazing.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>No Need to Argue</em> by <strong>The Cranberries</strong> - This is tremendously beautiful
music. The grunge adjacent riffs and half-yodeled vocals of “Zombie” were the
breakout hit, and most enduring moment, but I much prefer the subtle ballads.
Much of the music has that 1980s 4AD sound, and the vocals of Dolores
O’Riordan are peerless. Are they the best Irish band of all time? [<em>Memory</em>:
For some reason it took a really long time for the label to satisfy the demand
for a vinyl reissue of this one. They kept releasing small batches that would
sell for over a hundred dollars on Discogs. I personally had two pre-orders go
unsatisfied due to lack of stock. This one really highlighted the supply
issues of the vinyl revival.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Semantic Spaces</em> by <strong>Delerium</strong> - The huge pivot for Leeb/Fulber, what used
to be an ambient, instrumental project now brought female guest vocalist to
the fore. The formula was a massive success, and would continue for the next
two decades (with perhaps too little variation to hold interest). There are
still some fantastic instrumental tracks here, but the “pop songs” give the
work sustained interest that the prior records lacked. “Tribal Industrial”
music was all the rage in the mid-90s, but rarely would it sound this good.
[<em>Memory</em>: During a 1999 trip to Niagara Falls, we were driving back from a
fireworks display listening to modern rock station Edge 1002. The Canadian
radio programming felt exotic and exciting. The evening program played a
continuous mix of electronic sounds, almost all of which were unfamiliar to
me. A sequence of two tracks particularly caught my interest. One of them
turned out to be a new song by <strong>Moby</strong> (see 1999), but the other took a bit
more work to sort out. I wrote a detailed E-mail to the station describing
what I could remember. One word that I caught when the DJ did provide a list
of the artists was <strong>Delerium</strong>. The helpful staff at Edge 102 pointed me to
the Canadian electronic duo with that name as a potential lead. Thankfully
they had a great website, that even included short realvideo samples of their latest
work. It was there I found the song: “Flowers Become Screens” which would lead
to what would become one of my favorite artists in the early 2000s, and who I
still very much enjoy today.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Promenade</em> by <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> - [<strong>1994 FAVORITE</strong>]  - From a musical
arrangement perspective, and perhaps also from a lyrical perspective, this is
Neil Hannon’s most ambitious work. There are also plenty of his trademark
whimsey, especially on “A Drinking Song”, and Irish pastoral beauty on tracks
like “The Summerhouse”. But, the main thrust of this album are heady, complex
tunes like “When The Lights Go Out All Over Europe” and especially “Don’t Look
Down”. [<em>Memory</em>: Around 2012, I became aware of Brooklyn indie iconoclasts
<strong>Zambri</strong> who posted a cover of “Tonight We Fly” to their Soundcloud. It was
now the Spotify era and I could immediately research and locate the original
artist. That would lead me to this album and The Divine Comedy. Strangely, I
would go no farther, and it would take several years for me to listen to any
of the other tracks. It would then take a further few years for me to listen
to another record by the artist. I’m not sure why I engaged so slowly, but
eventually in 2017, I would have a new favorite artist.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bee Thousand*</em> by <em>Guided By Voices</em> - Still their finest work. While the
formula has varied little over their long career, it comes together here in a
way that it never quite would again. Perfect little 1-2 minute pop songs, with
just right amount of fuzz and distortion to give them a big punch. This is the
kind of album that needs to be played loud to the edge of discomfort. That
said, I don’t know that this ever gets enough credit for how beautiful the
melodies are as well.
[<em>Memory</em>: I saw them play at the Pitchfork Music Festival in 2011. I remember
losing my mind when the played “Gold Star for Robot Boy”. While writing this I
wondered if there was any video of their festival performance out there. On
youtube I found a video of that song from a perspective that felt very
familiar. What did I see in front of the camera? It was the back of my head,
clearly losing my mind getting into the tunes.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Holy Bible</em> by <strong>Manic Street Preachers</strong> - Based on the lyrical content,
the label didn’t release this in the USA. So like most everyone over here, I
didn’t hear it until many years later. That is a shame, as it really has a
surprisingly fresh, punk inspired sound that was contrary the prevailing
trends of the day. British music was mostly an isolated, and independent scene
from the alt rock that was happening on the other side of the Atlantic, and
this album might be the most representative artifact of that era. It has been
called the most negative album ever made, and the lyrics are mostly coming
from a very dark place. Behind the gloom is a kind of rage that offers a way
to a different place. This album contains the legendary runon song title:
“Ifwhiteamericatoldthetruthforonedayit’sworldwouldfallapart”, and it is a great
song! [<em>Memory</em>: I became aware of these guys watching a Glastonbury annual
retrospective on HDNet (a channel that played HDTV content in the early, novel
days of the technology) in 2007. This mysterious record that hadn’t yet had an
official USA release was heralded as a cult classic, and my interest was
piqued enough to import a copy.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Vauxhall And I</em> by <strong>Morrissey</strong> - In retrospect, this feels like the last
album of his classic period. We are still very much in the sphere of <strong>The
Smiths</strong> with elements of anthemic Britpop sprinkled in. It is loaded with
classic songs that still feature heavily in his live shows like <em>Now My Heart
is Full</em> and frequent closer <em>Speedway</em>. The highlight for me are the tender
moments like “Hold on to Your Friends” and “I am Hated for Loving” that have a
kind of openness and sincerity that is rare in the Moz’s catalog. [<em>Memory</em>:
When I was very into WYSP modern rock radio, they were playing one song that
was very different from the typical hard rock that comprised most of the
playlist. It was “The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get”. The whimsical
crooning was confounding to my 14 brain, but it made a favorable impression.
When Napster would become a thing several years later, it would be one of the
first songs I sought out. It would take another eight years until 2008 when I
bought his latest best of compilation. From there I would gradually become a
scholar of the entire Morrissey catalog.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Downward Spiral</em> by <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> - I do really enjoy this album,
but unlike almost everyone else in the world, it is not my favorite of
Trent’s. I prefer the slick synthpop that came before, and the prog epic that
came after more than this heralded release. That said, there is a lot to like
here, even if I find it hard to engage with something this angry as I settle
into the contentment of middle age. The hits are great, but the filler..is
filler, and this isn’t one that I listen to in whole very often anymore. That
said, every now and then, there is nothing that I need more than a listen to
this. [<em>Memory</em>: When this came out, this “band” seemed to dark and aggressive
to me. I saw all the kids in their NIN shirts at school, but I didn’t listen
to this album until many years later, and after I was a big fan of the albums
that were release on either side of this one. Weirdly, this record makes me
think about Circuit City. The electronics retailer sold CDs at a significant
discount as a loss leader. I bought nearly the entire NIN catalog at the store
in the late 90s early 2000s. This album was one of the last I bought at the
State College location before it closed around 2009.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>MTV Unplugged in New York</em> by <strong>Nirvana</strong> - This will be the only release on
my list by this legendary band. While I enjoy both <em>Nevermind</em> and <em>In Utero</em>,
neither are a complete work in my opinion. The high points are amazing, but
the low points are very mediocre. This is a wonderful, but kind of strange
live recording. Very few of the hits are here, but many of the mellower tunes
that didn’t really work on the studio albums sound great here. There are a ton
of covers, which are probably the better known cuts from the show: <strong>Bowie</strong>’s”The Man
Who Sold The World”, “Jesus Doesn’t Want Me for a Sunbeam” by <strong>The
Vasilines</strong>, and no less than 3(!) tracks from the <strong>Meat Puppets</strong> second
record. This would serve as the exclamation point on a brief, but very notable
career, and would drive interest in some pretty great music by other artists.
[<em>Memory</em>: It is hard to remember a time when live albums could be mega hits,
and spawn multiple tracks getting serious radio airplay. That said, that is
how it was in the winter of 1994/95. This record was everywhere.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</em> by <strong>Pavement</strong> - This gets the reputation of the
“mainstream” release by these guys, but I’m not sure that is quite right. This
is much the same as what came immediately before and after, but for a brief
moment that aligned with what was en vogue. In 1994 their was a tolerance for
a wide range of sounds in mainstream rock, and this shambolic outfit reaped
the benefits of that climate. “Cut Your Hair” is the song you will see used in
TV promotions, but for me, “Rage Life” is the definitive statement. The track
stands both musically and lyrically in opposition of the perceived prevalent
trends of the contemporary rock world. Ironically, this song was released
at a time when the prevailing trends mattered the least. [<em>Memory</em>: In general
the headliners at the Pitchfork Music festival were disappointing, but 2010
was a different story. And these guys closed out the festival on Sunday with a
bang. I can still see Stephen Malkmus doing a high leg kick as they kicked
into “Cut Your Hair”.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Vitology</em> by <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> - This album was released at the peak of the
band’s relevance to popular culture, and it delivered. The aggressive rockers
like “Last Exit” and “Whipping”a re still there, but they are rapidly becoming
more about the story ballads like “Nothingman” and “Better Man”. No longer
young punks, the Springsteen’s of the 90s were born. [<em>Memory</em>: The release of
this album was a huge event. I remember stories on the news about people
lining up at stores at midnight on Tuesday for a copy. I remember being
amazed that some folks were still buying a vinyl copy! Little did I know that
I would return to the format 14 years later. I now too have a vinyl copy of
Vitology.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dummy</em> by <strong>Portishead</strong> - A truly strange record. An especially atmospheric
brand of trip-hop, with vocals by <strong>Beth Gibbons</strong> that sound like they were
designed for use in a horror film. The kind of album to be listened to in a
dark room with a glass of whiskey, neat. [<em>Memory</em>: It took me a long time to
appreciate this. I loved the last Portishead record immediately, but it took
me a bit to appreciate the more trip-hop heavy music on this classic.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Monster</em> by <em>R.E.M.</em> - A shocking return to heavier rock sounds at release,
it still stands as a noted left turn 20 years after. After several albums of
quieter, roots rock inspired faire, “What’S the Frequency Kenneth” was a big
jolt to the fanbase. At the time opinions were mixed, but this now is mostly
universally accepted among their finest work. [<em>Memory</em>: This was a band that
I was actually very into at the time. I was also a fan of their earlier punk
inspired work, so the heavier sound was less of a shock to me.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Superunknown</em> by <strong>Soundgarden</strong> - A lot has been said about the disjointed
sensibilities of the metal inclined instrumentalists of the band and their 60s
pop loving front man. This is the album where that tension is fully starting to
show, and produce sonic gold like major hits “Spoonman” and “Black Hole Sun”. The
latter was everywhere in 1994, and for good reason. The mixture of grunge
metal and psychedelia was a revelation. [<em>Memory</em>: I really liked these guys
at the time. It took me many years to realize the parallels between this music
and the latter day <strong>Beatles</strong> music I was obsessed with at the time. That
said I never bought this CD in the 90s since it came from the “Metal” section
of the Columbia House catalog, which was not going to fly in my family.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Purple</em> by <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong> - In many ways, 1994 was when alternative
music crossed into the mainstream, and there was no bigger example of that
than “Interstate Love Song”. Looking back, the track is a masterful example of
an band dialing back their sound just enough to get on mainstream pop radio,
while retaining their core essence. I have to wonder what some of the folks
who bought the album based solely on that song though of the far heavier tunes
like “Meatplow” and “Army Ants”. I know what I think of them, they are
probably my favorite work by these guys. [<em>Memory</em>: I like to think I have an
usually objective ear, and this is one of those albums that gives me a bit of
proof. Throughout the 90s and 00s there was a prevailing narrative that this
band were poseurs and imitators of more authentic acts like <strong>Pearl Jam</strong>. I
never saw it. I only saw an appealing combination of 90s hard rock and 60s
psychedelia (that would be joined by garage rock and other influences later).
The respect given to these guys really started to climb in the 2010s, and
today I am far from the only person who gives them credit as one of the most
interesting and enduring 90s alternative acts.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tortoise</em> by <strong>Tortoise</strong> - A lot is made about <strong>Talk Talk</strong> and <strong>Slint</strong>
giving birth to the post-rock genre, but for me, this is where it really
starts. There is something about the particular atmospherics here, with the
jazzy, wide open soundscapes that define the early post-rock sound. Soon,
other acts would dial up the intensity and create a crescendo heavy variant of
the genre, but Tortoise’s more leisurely approach still sounds great today.
[<em>Memory</em>: I saw these guys play a now defunct Buffalo venue called Soundlab
in the summer of 2010. It was a great show that made me appreciate the Math
Rock elements of their sound that doesn’t come across as strongly on their
early records.]</p></li>

<h2>1995<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Even as a child, I felt pretty connected to the pop music of the day, and that
would intensify as teenager. That said, 1995 was probably the most out of step I
would ever be with the music that was being released. I was very much looking
back to the sounds of the 60s and 70s and could barely care about the hits of
the day. The year that I started high school, I was way more interested in
classic rock radio than I was the modern rock most of my peers were listening
to. I missed some classic records that I would only discover in retrospect,
including my favorites below.+</p>

<li><p><em>Fun Trick Noisemaker</em> by <strong>The Apples in Stereo</strong> - I’m a much bigger fan of
the latter day, <strong>ELO</strong> tinged incarnation of this band. I like the earlier
garage pop version as well, but this is really the only record from that era
that stands out for me. I feel like they had things right on this first
record, and spent the next 5-6 trying to recreate that sound. I also feel like
the amateur production values here suit the music better than the more
elaborate productions that were to come. [<em>Memory</em>: When this got reissued on
vinyl, it was the moment that I realized I would have the opportunity to own
the large majority of my favorites on that format.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Great Escape</em> by <strong>Blur</strong> - The record where they fully embrace their
jaunty, hyper-English side. What was hinted at on <em>Parklife</em> takes full form
here. They must have been such a cheerful, brightly colored alternative to the
other BritPop offerings of the day. It would all change again after this of
course, but this will always be what they do best in my opinion. I like some
of the latter day singles, but this is pretty much my off-ramp for this band.
[<em>Memory</em>: These guys barely made a dent in the USA, and at this point, they
were almost completely unknown. I can only imagine how much my Beatlemaniac
self would have loved this at the time. There was no internet to know about
this kind of thing back then!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Outside</em> by <strong>David Bowie</strong> - Peak 90s Bowie, and the work of an artist who
was still working very hard to innovate while capturing the spirit of the
current age. This is “art installation music” and modernist in that very 1990s
kind of way. This is the music of the early internet age. It is also still
very much a <strong>David Bowie</strong> record, and a great one at that. I didn’t really
connect with this as much as his classic work back then, but not believe it to
stand among his very finest work. [<em>Memory</em>: In the late 90s I was a huge
Bowie fan, and I worked with another “music person” who only really liked this
record of his. We listened to it a bunch back then at work, but I just didn’t
get it back then.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Alien Lanes</em> by <strong>Guided By Voices</strong> - The second (and final) record from
their peak era. A collection of perfect little lowfi pop gems, they would
never quite capture this again. [<em>Memory</em>: Back in the early days of Pandora,
it played “Game of Pricks” for me, and I was instantly hooked.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>To Bring You My Love</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - An interesting era for Polly Jean.
She dialed up the glam and amped up the rock, yet kept the essential character
that made the first two records so interesting. Its odd that this was such a
commercial breakthrough, but anything seemed possible in the mid-90s. As fast
as these changes came, they would be gone and replaced with something else
that was new and wonderful. [<em>Memory</em>: I never liked this one as much as what
came before and after. When the vinyl reissue series happened in the 2020
time frame, I thought long and hard about if I needed to add this one. I got
them all, and wow I am glad that I did.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Wowee Zowee</em> by <strong>Pavement</strong> - This is one of those times that I do not agree
with the crowd. This is almost universally considered their masterpiece. I
like it, but it is a little too long. There is a great single album here, but
not everything needed to make the cut. I think the albums before an after are
sharper statements, and have better focus in the playful and more series
sounds that proceeded and followed this one. That said, It is a still another
great record that I enjoy listening to, just not as much as those others.
[<em>Memory</em>: There was a used copy of this that sat on the counter at City
Lights records for years. I considered buying it, but never did. I never owned
a physical copy of this until the circa 2010 vinyl reissues that Matador did.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Different Class</em> by <strong>Pulp</strong> - I did’t know about this music in the 90s, but
if I did, I would have loved it. Like many American youth of the time, I was
attracted to the brightness of English rock music that was a big contrast with
the murky post-grunge of the day. This has those wonderful dance elements that
you needed to look across the pond to find. It also has the high quality
songwriting that blows away the knuckle-draggers that were dominating the
radio in the US. [<em>Memory</em>: I became aware of these guys and this album when
William Shatner’s cover of “Common People” was making the rounds in the 2003
time frame. What a strange point of entry, but regardless I’m glad I found my
way.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Bends</em> by <strong>Radiohead</strong> - With how inventive of a guitarist Jonny
Greenwood is, It is a real shame that this is their last album as a guitar
based act. While the guitars would make their appearances in what came after,
this is the last time they had a staring role. A tremendous rock album, and a
milestone of the BritPop movement. “My Iron Lung” will always be one of their
best songs. [<em>Memory</em>: For years I tried to claim this my favorite of their
records. I think I was just making some passive resistance to the rise of
electronic rock in the early 2000s.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ocean Beach</em> by <strong>Red House Painters</strong> - I always feel a little guilty that I
don’t like the music that Mike Kozelek made after he got his life together, as
what he was doing in his darker moments. That said, this pleasant airy folk
rock record holds up well to his earlier work. Maybe it is because there is
just enough melancholy in tracks like “Summer Dress”. [<em>Memory</em>: In 2009 I
spent some time as a tourist in San Francisco after a business trip to the
region. I decided to do a “Red House Painters Walking Tour” where I visited
all the places he name checked in the albums/songs, including Ocean Beach.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> by <strong>Smashing Pumpkins</strong> - [<strong>1995
FAVORITE</strong>] - There have been quite a few bands in history that for a brief
moment in time, managed to completely transcend themselves and make music that
seems completely beyond what they should be capable of. Smashing Pumpkins
1995-97 may be the most extreme case of this. A period of stunning creativity
and productivity, these three years alone make them legends. This album is so
over the top and wonderful from the little piano ditty it starts with, to the
lyrically preposterous yet incredible “Bullet With Butterfly Wings”, and what
feels like countless amazing and blistering rock tunes. People who say
<em>Siamese Dream</em> is better than this are crazy. [<em>Memory</em>: It’s hard to
separate this from <em>The Aeroplane Flies High</em>, which collected the singles and
B-sides that were released in their glorious era. I actually loved that
first.]</p></li>

<h2>1996<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I look at the below image, I can confidently say that I didn’t hear any of
these records in the year of their release. I was very familiar with, and a fan
of many songs off of these albums, but none had found their way into my
collection. This is partly because I was very much in the peak of my backward
looking Beatlemania, and making my first explorations into growing favorites
like <strong>Pink Floyd</strong> and <strong>David Bowie</strong>. It was also because many of the new
artists I was interested in, seemed to conflict with the religious convictions
of my parents. It is strange to think about now, but back then artists like
<strong>Soundgarden</strong>, <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong>, and even <strong>Jamiroquai</strong> felt slightly
dangerous and out of step with the conservative values of my family.</p>
<p>Thinking about this selection today, this feels like a pivot year between the
rock heavy early 90s and the rise of pop in the latter half of the decade. There
are also quite a few indie classics there, including a few landmark albums that
would be very influential on the dominant music trends of the next decade
(<strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong>, <strong>Stereolab</strong>, <strong>Olivia Tremor Control</strong>,
<strong>Tortoise</strong>). Finally, Britpop is starting to reach full bloom with classics
from <strong>Divine Comedy</strong> and <strong>Manic Street Preachers</strong>, and an American band has
decided to join in (<strong>Lilys</strong>). If there a single dominant theme here, it is
without question garage rock. That influence can be heard in artists as diverse
as <strong>Olivia Tremor Control</strong>, <strong>Pearl Jam</strong>, <strong>Lilys</strong> and especially here in
the album by <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong>. Its really clear to see the roots of 2000s
indie in many of the albums listed here.</p>

<li><p><em>Boys for Pele</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - [<strong>1996 FAVORITE</strong>] - A remarkable record,
produced by an artist who was experiencing a significant level of artistic
freedom for the first time. While we have the first elements of the electronic
music that would dominate the next few records, this is mostly still an
acoustic, piano driven affair. The song structure and the fundamental
structure of the album is quite different from anything that had really come
before by any artist. The lyrics are more impenetrable than anything on her
first two records, but they are evocative of multitude of emotions. I don’t
know that there is another album where I understand so poorly what the artist
is singing about, but I know exactly what they mean. So many of my favorite
songs of all time are on this album, and it is one that I will never tire of.
[<em>Memory</em>: When I was in grad school, I met a woman studying in another
program through a friend in her lab. We connected very deeply over this
record, and the next three times our friend group met up at the bar, we spent
the entire evening chatting. I’m pretty sure everyone else thought we were
going to start dating. I might have even thought that for a brief moment, but
we really both just really like that album, and the artist.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tidal</em> by <strong>Fiona Apple</strong> - This feels so conventional by the modern
standards of the artist. The first album is definitely quite a bit more
straightforward than what was to come, but no less interesting. The moody,
singer-songwriter material on offer here is just as stunning today as it was
back then. “Criminal” was the big hit back then, as much for its lolita-esque
music video, as the song it was promoting. Most of the other material holds up
much better today, especially “Shadowboxer” and the softer tracks like
“Sullen Girl” and “Never is a Promise”. [<em>Memory</em>: I got my copy of this album
from my sister as a hand me down in the summer of 1998. She didn’t connect
with it beyond “Criminal”. I was in the heights of my <strong>Tori</strong>-mania and this
was a great fit for that time in my life. This album brings back vivid
memories of driving my metallic purple 1997 Dodge Neon to the Penn
State satellite campus I attended in Reading, PA. Many of those freshman
mornings I would have this in the Sony Discman that was playing though a
cassette deck adapter.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>If You’re Feeling Sinister</em> by <strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong> - One of their best
albums, but unlike most fans, I do not consider it to be their very best. This
is a tremendous indie-folk record, but for me it isn’t quite as effective as
the more spare, unpolished EPs that came before, or the slicker poppier music
that would come in the next decade. However, there are some great tracks here,
especially “Like Dylan in the Movies” and “Seeing Other People”. [<em>Memory</em>:
These guys dominated my listening in the 2004-2006 time frame. This is the
soundtrack to the end of my academic career and start of my first job.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>First Band on the Moon</em> by <strong>The Cardigans</strong> - “Lovefool” was a massive hit,
and while a great song, it sells these guys a bit short. The kind of pop music
that can only come from Scandinavia, this is sweet, but surprisingly moody
music. It would get even darker from here on out, but there is a real chill to
the atmospherics and songwriting on this record. [<em>Memory</em>: I was listening to
this a lot in the Summer of 1999, and it reminds me very much of my first
engineering internship. I would listen to CDs on my Windows NT machine that I
used make CAD drawings. This was one of the discs that was on repeat.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Casanova</em> by <strong>Divine Comedy</strong> - There are many of the typical elements here:
the sense of humor, the chamber pop sensibility, the layered harmonies by the
artist. However, this is the closest this guy has ever come to actually making
Britpop. It is the eccentric kind of Britpop made by the likes of <strong>Blur</strong>,
and it isn’t quite all the way there, but if you squint, it is there. For many
folks this is the best record, for me it is in the middle of a very strong
pack of records. [<em>Memory</em>: This was the second album I tried from this guy
after losing my mind listening to <strong>Promenade</strong> repeatedly for about 5 years.
I remember wondering why I waited so long to dig deeper.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dance Hall at Louise Point</em> by <strong>John Parish &amp; PJ Harvey</strong> - This is the
first record in the quieter, artier sound that would become her predominant
style in her more recent work. There still are some aggressive, abrasive
moments here, but they unfold in a creeping, pensive way that is also very
representative of the latter day Polly Jean. “Heela” is such a remarkable
song, and will always be one of my favorites. Even though we would get a few
more records in a more conventional rock style, this is the start of the PJ we
know and love today. [<em>Memory</em>: When I was working my way through her catalog
in the 2007 time frame, I bought a used CD copy of this for about a dollar and
didn’t know what to make of it. This took me a while to fully appreciate, but
it is not one of my very favorites.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Traveling Without Moving</em> by <strong>Jamiroquai</strong> - It is hard to think about this
record without picturing that legendary video for “Virtual Insanity” and I’m
sure I would never have heard this album without that amazing promo clip. That
said, this is a funky, highly enjoyable affair that is more than a little
derivative of <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong>. Much like the master it has patterned itself
after, what we get here is a pleasant mix of funky upbeat tunes, and pretty
soulful ballads. [<em>Memory</em>: This makes me think of a quant music “format” that
I collected in the late 90s. CDs were expensive (and in some cases, evil in
the religion I was raised in) and I couldn’t always acquire the latest tunes I
liked from TV or radio. The internet of the late 90s provided me an
approximate solution, the MIDI file. I downloaded the minimalist, instrumental
sequencer versions of popular tunes that I didn’t have for real. I remember
downloading a particularly impressive version of “Virtual Insanity” in the
(new at the time) XG MIDI format. It didn’t have the vocal track, but I could
still enjoy that funky groove.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Better Can’t Make Your Life Better</em> by <strong>Lilys</strong> - I love <strong>The Kinks</strong> and
so apparently does Kurt Heasley, the man behind <strong>Lilys</strong>. This feels like a
love letter to the pre “Village Green” <strong>Kinks</strong> and it is expertly done. The
90s were a time of significant interest in the sounds of the mid 60s, and this
is a expert recreation and modernization of the garage rock sound. [<em>Memory</em>:
There was a vinyl copy of this at one of my favorite Rochester shops (The Bop
Shop) for probably about 5 years before I finally pulled the trigger and
picked it up. Why was I delaying, this is wonderful stuff!]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Everything Must Go</em> by <strong>Manic Street Preachers</strong> - These guys were always
one of the heavier BritPop acts, but this is where the balladry and pop
sensibility started to really creep in. That said, it totally works. A really
polished and literate set of tracks that never get old. The epic “Elvis
Impersonator…” returns to one of their favorite topics, the relationships
between the UK and America. Admittedly their frank consideration of that topic
is why they never really made it over here, and why I didn’t hear anything
from them until the mid 2000s. I would have absolutely loved it back then, and
I certainly do now! [<em>Memory</em>: “A Design for Life” is the ultimate BritPop
anthem. It was made to be screamed along with by a Glastonbury festival crowd.
I got a noise violation letter for jamming it too loud at in my State College
apartment in 2007.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Older</em> by <strong>George Michael</strong> - This album sold millions of copies, but not as
many millions of the two prior, and therefore was perceived as a failure at
the time. Today it sounds like a revelation. A sophisticated, mature affair
with some of his best songwriting and vocal performances, this was not fully
appreciated at release. “Jesus to a Child” is a remarkable song, perhaps his
very finest. Everything has such a warm, atmospheric vibe. Maybe the best 90s
sophista-pop record. [<em>Memory</em>: I certainly remember the singles from this
record getting played (especially on VH1), and had them on a greatest hits
compilation, but I didn’t listen to the whole album until 2021. After reading
a biography on the artist I streamed all the records and was blown away by
this one.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Who Can you Trust</em> by <strong>Morcheeba</strong> - The big breakout for these guys, and a
wonderful evolution of trip-hop. The kind of smooth and elegant record that
you could replay to infinity and not tire of. It is almost like
<strong>Portishead</strong> has been polished up and made TV commercial ready, but somehow
still very compelling. [<em>Memory</em>: Early in the 2020 pandemic year, I made an
effort to listen through to albums I acquired in the CD era and had forgot
about. I rediscovered this brilliant LP though that process.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dusk at Cubist Castle</em> by <strong>The Olivia Tremor Control</strong> - I like the pop
songs on this record quite a bit, but the ambient, instrumental parts just
don’t work as well as the ones on the next (and final) record. No denying how
influential everything about this would be on a whole generation of psych rock
revivalists. [<em>Memory</em>: These guys always remind me of my move to Rochester,
NY. I was very into them around that time, and they would also reissue all
their records on vinyl around that time.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In Sides</em> by <strong>Orbital</strong> - The definitive album oriented techno record. They
always liked to work in longer forms, but this whole album is built around
10-20 minute chunks of music. I’m always going back and forth between this and
the brown album as my favorite, but without question “Out There Somewhere” is
there absolute best moment. Techno in general hasn’t aged well, but this still
sounds amazing today. I really love the way they mix in real instruments with
all the electronics here. It gives a texture that a lot of the electronic
music of the day did  not have [<em>Memory</em>: One of my favorite things to play on
a run, it is hard to not think about exercise when I hear this record.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>No Code</em> by <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> - This has always been my favorite of their albums,
and I feel like the world has caught up with me. The stripped back garage
mentality suits them well, and captures their live nature better than any of
their other work. Short, hard-hitting songs that avoid the extended bombast
that they sometimes tend to fall into. They also mix in one of their sweetest
balads in “Off He Goes”, and the greatest <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> song not sung by Eddie
Vedder in “Mankind”. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought a used copy of this at a secondhand
store called Cash Converters around 1999. I payed a dollar for it, showing how
unappreciated it was at the time. I later payed almost 40 bucks for the vinyl
reissue, and many others were happy to do so as well.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</em> by <strong>R.E.M.</strong> - A clear attempt to return to a more
arty, low-key sound after the straightforward rock of <strong>Monster</strong>. This was
very under the radar at the time, but many people (including myself) learned
to appreciate this over time. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought my CD copy of this record
when I was working as a summer intern at NASA Glenn in the summer of 2023.
There was a message board where you could post things for sale, and I bought
this from someone along with <strong>Hum</strong>’s <em>You’d Prefer an Astronaut</em>.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Down on the Upside</em> by <strong>Soundgarden</strong> - In my opinion, this is a highly
underrated follow-up to their breakout hit <em>Superunknown</em>. A return to more
conventional hard rock, with some elements of the singer-songwriter fare that
would dominate the early <strong>Chris Cornell</strong> solo career. This would have been a
great way for them to wrap up, except for the ill advised reunion in the
2010s. [<em>Memory</em>: “Blow Up the Outside World” was one of the very first MP3s I
downloaded from the internet. Weirdly I downloaded it from the FTP server
ran by a fellow student who I didn’t really care for at my high school. “Free”
music conquers all barriers.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</em> by <strong>Stereolab</strong> - 90s indie was wildly diverse and
often hard to categorize, and this might be the definitive album of the era.
Electronic tinged rock music with a Krautrock groove and a pop soul, there is
a little bit of everything here. This was the doorway to so many places for
me: <strong>Can</strong>, <strong>Kraftwerk</strong>, <strong>Bell and Sebastian</strong>, <strong>Of Montreal</strong>, and who
knows what else. [<em>Memory</em>: Maybe the most important record I sought out
because of the AllMusicGuide genre summaries. They considered this an indie
landmark, and that isn’t putting it strongly enough.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tiny Music…</em> by <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong> - Much like <em>No Code</em> (above), I
feel ahead of the times picking this record out as this band’s finest hour.
The combination of garage, psychedelia, and glam on offer here is a very
unique and memorable sound from a group that was often dismissed as
derivative. Here they sound very much ahead of the times, and almost sound a
little prophetic of the indie rock that would dominate the turn of the
millennium. [<em>Memory</em>: When I look at the cover of this record, I can’t help
but picture the Columbia House music club mailers and magazine adds that
seemed to feature this album for the better part of 1996-97.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Millions Now Living will Never Die</em> by <strong>Tortoise</strong> - This may be the
definitive post rock record. A straight up fusion of punk and jazz, this sound
has been attempted so many times, but very rarely this well. I sometimes
wonder if these guys are why I grew up to like jazz (particularly
electro-jazz) so much. [<em>Memory</em>: The name of this album has always fascinated
me, since it is titled after the greatest lie ever told by the religion I was
raised in. I wonder how that came to be?]</p></li>

<h2>1997<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have mentioned this several times, but it is important to know that I worked
on this project starting in 2020 and moving backwards in time. As a result,
milestones were observed in reverse. When I look at the records below, I can see
the influence of three very big factors for the very first time. First, this was
the year that I would have my first jobs that would bring in money that I could
use to purchase albums of my own choosing. Second, I got my drivers license
which allowed me to transport myself to the mall or Best Buy/Circuit City where
I could personally select the music I was interested in. This means for the
first time there are quite a few records on the list that were something that I
purchased with my own money in the year of release.</p>
<p>The third big event was something the whole world was going through at the same
time, the Internet. We didn’t yet have MP3s for music discovery, but static
webpages of dial-up and Web 1.0 were a wealth of information about the latest
activity and releases from my favorite artists. We had recently subscribed to
AOL at home, and it opened my eyes to a range of information about pop music and
a variety of other topics.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/1997.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1997" src="../_images/1997.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Primeirs Symptomes</em> by <strong>Air</strong> - An EP that serves as a great summary of what
makes these guys great. Light and pleasant French electronica, with an indie
rawness that made it sound more warm than slick. [<em>Memory</em>: I was aware of
this disk for years before I got a copy. The physical release was always an
expensive import, but through the magic of eMusic, I would get a digital copy
years later, and finally had the complete catalog of this band.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Earthling</em> by <strong>David Bowie</strong> - I’m proud to say that I have always been a
fan of 90s Bowie, even when others (even if they wont admit it now) were
saying he was over the hill. Some of the electronic sounds are dated now, but
it only adds to the charm. That Bowie magic is still here in a big way.
“Battle for Britain” is one of my absolute favorites of his without
qualification. [<em>Memory</em>: This brings together two of my biggest interests in
1997: Bowie and The Internet. Bowie was famously and early advocate for the
web, and one of the first artists to fully harness its power. I vividly
remember viewing a RealVideo encoded file at extremely low bitrate of the
video for the lead single “Little Wonder”. The sounds and the technology blew
my teenage mind.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Karma</em> by <strong>Delerium</strong> - [<strong>1997 FAVORITE</strong>] - My absolute favorite by these
guys also happens to be their most widely known. I do enjoy the <strong>Sarah
McLachlan</strong> fronted mega-hit “Silence” (and the late 90s is the only time
something like this would be a hit) but my favorite is the stunning “Euphoria
(Firefly)”. The combination of light industrial beats and world music
exoticism reached a peak on this record. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember playing this
for one of my friends on a drive, and their reaction was: “So this is the kind
of music you are into now, huh?”]</p></li>
<li><p><em>A Short Album About Love</em> by <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> - The artist claims to
have written this album before ever actually being in love, and I think it
shows. There is something charmingly detached about this collection of love
songs. A lot of the usual humour (“If”) and warmth (“Everybody Knows”) that
would typify the second act for this guy. Probably the beginning of the fully
mature work for Neil Hannon, and one of his absolute finest moments.
[<em>Memory</em>: When the vinyl reissues came out in 2020, it really made me see the
whole discography in a new light. I don’t know if any album climbed my
personal ranking more than this one. It really is the kind of thing that needs
to be listened to in whole, and hits hard in its short running length.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>So Much for the Afterglow</em> by <strong>Everclear</strong> - Music from this era hasn’t aged
very gracefully. Mostly a collection of post-grunge, nu-metal, and pop-punk,
late 90s rock was a collection of fads that haven’t generally stood the test
of time. The combination of power pop and mature singer songwriter themes on
display here have held up way better than most of the rock radio favorites of
the day. Also a pretty killer record from start to finish, which is also a
rarity for the era. [<em>Memory</em>: This is one of the few records from this year’s
list that I was actually into at the time of release. I really enjoyed the radio
hits, but it was the deep cut “Why I Don’t Believe in God” that made this a
classic album of my teen years. It really connected with where I was at this
point in my life, and also made me love the banjo as a rock instrument…until
a bunch of hacks ruined that in the 2010s.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>F# A# ∞</em> by <strong>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</strong> - The start of the journey for
these guys, and for the genre of chamber, apocalyptic post-rock as well.
Everything that they continue to do is already fully formed here. I don’t come
back to this one as much, because I feel like the formula was refined in the
later albums, but I always enjoy it when I do. Perhaps a bit more ambient with
meandering soundscapes that have been reduced in later efforts, and with a
generally lighter touch than the crescendo heavy later works. [<em>Memory</em>: The
<strong>Godspeed</strong> records seem to have always been perpetually in print on vinyl,
and I was able to buy this and complete my catalog of LPs back in the dark
ages of circa 2009.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mi  Media Naranja</em> by <strong>Labradford</strong> - In the 90s and early 2000s, <strong>Ennio
Morricone</strong> inspired post-rock was a fairly productive sub-genre. A lot of the
music sounds very much the same, and for me, this is the best product of that
scene. Moody, vaguely western soundscapes, that sound hopeless and spacious.
I’m not in the mood for this very often these days, but wow was I about 15-20
years ago. [<em>Memory</em>: This is the kind of record I would have never found
without the AllMusicGuide. Fairly obscure when I found it, and even more
obscure today, the AMG article on post-rock considered it a landmark of the
genre. I’m glad that it pointed me this way.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Flaming Pie</em> by <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> - In retrospect, this feels like one of
the most important albums in a very important career. For the first time you can
hear him coming to terms with his <strong>Beatles</strong> past, and fully engaging with a
musical future that both considers with what came before, and what lies ahead.
This was also the last record with the input and presence of his collaborator
in music and life, Linda. This is where things really started to come
together, and the brilliant final act of a brilliant musical career had it’s
start. [<em>Memory</em>: This was definitely the record I was most excited for at the
time. I was in the peak of my <strong>Beatles</strong> &amp; <strong>McCartney</strong> fandom, and this was
the first new release since I had discovered these artists (other than the
archival “Anthology” and “Live at the BBC” releases). I remember logging into
the MPL Records website to view the latest posts to the “Flamming Pie Gazette”
that provided updates on the production of the record. I was so excited to
hear a short clip of “The World Tonight” in RealVideo format. This record
invokes nostalgia not just for the music, but also the early web.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Surfacing</em> by <strong>Sarah McLachlan</strong> - This is one of those records that I
really enjoy, but wonder if its lasting effect has been negative. Up to this
point, women’s music had been arguably the highlight of 90s pop/rock. The likes
of <strong>PJ Harvey</strong>, <strong>Tori Amos</strong>, <strong>Alanis</strong> and countless other women were
making stunning, edgy work that was finding its way to the mainstream against
all odds. Once the record execs got a look at this lush, pretty record, it
felt like there was a massive shift in what they were willing to promote. I
certainly don’t want to blame <strong>McLachlan</strong> who is a master at this kind of
music, but why couldn’t it live side by side with all that other really
awesome stuff that wasn’t as easy to fit into the background of TV
commercials? [<em>Memory</em>: I heard “Building a Mystery” for the first time while
exercising at my physical therapist during a recovery session after breaking
my left ankle.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cherry Peel</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong> - Where it all began for Kevin Barnes, it
sounds stunningly small compared to where he would take his music. A
collection of good natured, lowfi pop songs with imaginative lyrics and
melodies, this project was solid from day one. “I can’t Stop Your Memory” is a
tiny masterpiece of retro-pop. It almost sounds like the 1967 <strong>Beatles</strong>
going back and making music the way they did in 1961. [<em>Memory</em>: Thanks to
eMusic, I probably heard this album years before I otherwise would have. The
cheap mp3 downloads allowed me to explore obscure back catalog records like
this one years before streaming made this trivial.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Brighten the Corners</em> by <strong>Pavement</strong> - A bit more put together than we are
used to from these guys,  but still had enough of that shambolic magic. That
said, this is clearly the work of a band and a front man who were starting to
outgrow their fundamental concept. [<em>Memory</em>: About 20 years after the release
of this record, Spotify radio kept playing the song “Harness Your Hopes” and I
couldn’t figure out why I didn’t know the track. Apparently left of this
album, how in the world did one of the most representatively perfect
<strong>Pavement</strong> songs not make the track list?]</p></li>
<li><p><em>OK Computer</em> by <strong>Radiohead</strong> - For a significant number of folks, this is
the best album of the 90s, but it isn’t even my top <strong>Radiohead</strong>
album of the decade. That said, it still is a classic transition record,
spanning their Britpop roots and the dreary, mixed-genre weirdness to come. I
feel like the best moments here are the quiet tracks like “Exit Music (For a
Film)” and “Lucky”. A few albums later they would learn to rock out more
effectively again. [<em>Memory</em>: Ironically (given the role they would later play
in legal downloads) this album reminds me more of the Napster era than any
other. I wasn’t totally ready to buy into these guys as the next big thing,
but I was happy to download a bunch of their stuff for no money. I now have
this, and many of their albums, on both CD and vinyl.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Unsound Methods</em> by <strong>Recoil</strong> - I don’t find myself listening to <strong>Alan
Wilder</strong>’s dark ambient project much these days, but I certainly found it very
compelling 20 or so years ago. Some of this sounds a bit silly and dated now,
and not edgy in the way it did back then. The more goth tracks like “Incubus”
have aged better than the beat poetry based things like “Luscious Apparatus”.
Probably best enjoyed as a late 90s time capsule now. [<em>Memory</em>: I got this at
one of those “used goods” stores that were everywhere in the late 90s. The
shop (Cash Converters) was often a great source of underrated records by
popular artists, and obscure gems like this.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Either/Or</em> by <strong>Elliot Smith</strong> - This is a stunning little collection of
gentle indie rock tunes. The most beautiful anyone had made sadness sound
since <strong>Nick Drake</strong>. [<em>Memory</em>: Like many folks, I didn’t properly get into
his music until his passing in 2004. It would take me to acquire this
masterpiece, but it was one of the first bunch of Emusic downloads I made in
early 2006.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hard Normal Daddy</em> by <strong>Squarepusher</strong> - If there was ever a genre I wanted
more of, it would be whatever this is. This distinctively funky brand of
break beat laden, jazz-tronica is very unique. This guy is somewhat a genre
unto himself. That said, the early albums all sound fairly similar, and this
is far and above the best of the bunch. [<em>Memory</em>: I discovered this guy on
the jazz-tronica show on XM Beyond Jazz, and was able to get his most recent
work. I knew from the AMG and other sources, this was considered his finest
work. I would have had to import an expensive CD copy from England on Amazon,
so this was an early Amazon download for me.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Radiator</em> by <strong>Super Furry Animals</strong> - Warm and comfy indie rock, with some
clear links to late 60s <strong>Beatles</strong>-like psych. This gets lumped in with the
Britpop crowd, but that link is more temporal than musical. A really fun
record that is quite a breath of fresh air next to the dreary American rock
music of the day. [<em>Memory</em>: Another classic record that I found out about on
the various music retrospective sites of the early 2000s. Back then you had to
import CD copies of this kind of thing, and I did.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Urban Hymns</em> by <strong>The Verve</strong> - Sometimes a song can be too good that it
overshadows a fantastic album. So it is with “Bitter Sweet Symphony” and this
record. That song was so ubiquitous in 1997, that all the other gems on this
album tend to go unremembered. That soaring symphonic sample on “Symphony”
tends to obscure more subtle mini-masterpieces like “Luck Man”, “Sonnet”, and
especially “The Drugs Don’t Work”. [<em>Memory</em>: I was sitting in a high school
class (Tech Lab 2000) when one of my fellow students put on this CD, and I
heard “Bitter Sweet Symphony” for the first time. Everyone in the classroom
loved it. Weeks later I was totally sick of a song that had become massive and
unavoidable. I never considered buying a copy for myself. I wouldn’t pick up
the disk until a year or two had passed, and I was floored by what I heard.]</p></li>

<h2>1998<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This was the year that I graduated from high school and started college. I feel
like this is a time in life when I was supposed to be paying very close
attention to pop music, but I just wasn’t. My interests were more about classic
rock and the alternative acts of the recent past. That said a few of these
records were something I was into at the time, but the large majority were
discovered in the last two decades of my life. In retrospect it was a
diverse and memorable year for music. The late 90s were a crazy anything goes
time for music and the below list is very much in that spirit.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/1998.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1998" src="../_images/1998.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>Moon Safari</em> by <strong>Air</strong> - Some bands go on for years, and always seem like
they are trying to live up to a massive debut record. This is one of those
cases. It’s not that they haven’t made some amazing records in the meantime,
but this one is so original and definitive it almost feels unfair to hold them
to this standard again. Such a dreamy and chill mood, there have been many
imitators of this kind of down-tempo psychedelic, electronica, but none match
this effort. A nice mix of instrumentals and vocal “pop songs”, I’ve listened
to this hundreds of times and am not the least bit sick of it. [<em>Memory</em>: As
much as I like this now, I was very resistant to it at the time. My co-worker
was listening to it non-stop in the months after its release, but I really
didn’t connect with it for some reason. It was when I heard it played before a
<strong>Creed</strong> concert (of all places!) a year or so later I realized that I
actually love it. That remains true today.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>From the Choirgirl Hotel</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong>  - [<strong>1998 FAVORITE</strong>] - The
creative peak of her early period, this is a fantastic record. I still prefer
the rawness of <strong>Pele</strong> ever so slightly, but this is definitely my second
favorite of her albums. This managed to both turn up the rock band elements,
while adding in strong elements of electronic music. The top rate vocals and
piano are are still there of course along with some of the last songwriting in
the original <strong>Tori Amos</strong> style that we would hear for quite some time. The
one two sequence of “Jackie’s Strength” and “Iieee” is one of my favorite in
music history. [<em>Memory</em>: I was already interested in this album pre-release
due to her contributions to the excellent <strong>Great Expectations: Soundtrack</strong>.
I was out washing my car on a beautiful early summer day and heard “Spark” on
WMMR. That was my entry point to one of my lifelong favorite artists.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Three EPs</em> by <strong>The Beta Band</strong> - So much more than “Dry The Rain” (as
heard in Hollywood’s version of “High Fidelity”). Admittedly the selection of
this band, record, and that specific song was perfect for the scene, as this
is exactly the kind of thing you would hear play in a late 90s independent
record store. Really interesting long-form, high rhythmic folk-inspired indie
rock songs. They didn’t last long as a band, but they left some great records
behind, and this is the best of them all. [<em>Memory</em>: Like 99% of the world, I
did find out about this from the movie “High Fidelity”. I didn’t track down a
copy of the record until a year or two later. This was one of the last
(perhaps the very last) record to become part of the “original 400” CDs in my
collection.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Music Has the Right to Children</em> by <strong>Boards of Canada</strong> - Electronic music
that manages to separate itself by its originality and uncompromising quality.
A mysterious band, these guys have released music sparingly over their career.
While there have been other high-points, this is still the definitive
statement. Much of the best from this record manages to sound like music from
a highly damaged children’s TV show (see “Roygbiv” and “Aquarius”). [<em>Memory</em>:
One of those records I can thank the early RateYourMusic for. I had actually
downloaded several of the tracks several years before I actually had the funds
to track down a copy of this somewhat expensive (at the time) release.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Gran Turismo</em> by <strong>The Cardigans</strong> - This dark and moody record was quite a
shock after the sugary pop of their first two records, and the big hits that
came with them. Still fantastic pop music, but this time with a more
introspective and atmospheric electronic backdrop. Lead vocalist Nina
Peerson’s sweet, somewhat slight voice is the perfect counterpoint for the all
the fuzzy darkness. A lost classic of sorts. [<em>Memory</em>: Of all the albums that
came out that year, this is the one I most associate with my freshman year in
college. Mostly because of “My Favorite Game” serving as the intro song for
the PlayStation classic game Gran Tursimo II. I played a lot of PS1 my
freshman year in college.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Before These Crowded Streets</em> by <strong>The Dave Matthews Band</strong> - I feel
validated that there seems to be a growing consensus that this was their best
work. Certainly the most complex and jazz inspired record, it holds my
interest in a way the other records that came before and after does not.
“Crush” is by far the finest track they have produced. [<em>Memory</em>: I was very
resistant of these guys. They always seemed like a cliche of college aged guys
in the late 90s, a demographic that I had recently joined. This was the album
that grabbed me, but I would never connect with them again.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>And you Think You Know What Life’s About</em> by <strong>Dishwalla</strong> - A few of the
post-grunge bands were doing something different, and these guys certainly
were. Inspired by shoegaze and the Britpop sounds of the day, this is an
interesting second record from a unique American band. “Once In A While” was a
minor alt rock radio hit at the time, but this album is much more interesting
in whole. [<em>Memory</em>: I really liked this record when it came out, and it
probably is because I was connecting with the sounds they were borrowing from
other, more British acts I would discover later.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fin De Siecle</em> by <strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> - It can be really difficult to pick
a best album from an artist that is this consistently great. It has a little
bit of everything, the jokey fun tracks, the serious slice of life stories,
presented both as little pop songs, and chamber epics. It even has his biggest
UK hit in “National Express” which is a terrific little track. There isn’t
really a weak point here either. Top class. [<em>Memory</em>: I discoverd and
absorbed all of his records in two relatively short periods of time. This one
was something that I spent a lot of time with towards the end of my first
window of obsession. Why I stopped with this terrific record I am not sure.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Electro-Shock Blues</em> by <strong>Eels</strong> - A very sad record that manages to not be
terribly depressing. I think it is because it is a story of managing how one
deals with bad things happening and the path to a brighter place. Still his
finest work. [<em>Memory</em>: I had been looking for a vinyl copy of this for years,
when I finally found one that I could import from Germany at a good price in
early 2023.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Is This Desire?</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> - A transitionary work and a great one.
This was the pivot in her catalog from the aggression of the early records to
a more subtle and diverse approach that continues to this day. We still have
some of the growling early Polly Jean here, but the gentler more mature voice
becomes the dominant sound as things progress. [<em>Memory</em>: I didn’t really get
into her music until the more folk inspired records of the 2000s, but when I
took a look at the back catalog, this was my clear favorite from the more pure
rock era of her career.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hooray For Tuesday</em> by <strong>The Minders</strong> - A pure pop classic from the E6
folks. As much a triumph of Robert Schneider’s production as the musicians
writing and playing the music. It always feels like <strong>Dr. Dog</strong> and a bunch of
other pop-revivalists are continuously trying to make a version of this record
and falling short. “Comfortably Tucked Up Inside” is  remarkable song.
[<em>Memory</em>: This is an album that was always on the best of E6 lists that I was
consulting around 2006-07, but was much more difficult to source. There was
eventually a CD reissue that allowed me to experience this gem.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Big Calm</em> by <strong>Morcheeba</strong> - In its final form, trip-hop started to take on
qualities similar to vocal jazz. This is the definitive record of the form.
That lounge scene on the cover definitely captures the general mood here.
[<em>Memory</em>: Other record that I burned from my friend at my job at the time. I
found a lot of favorites that way evidently.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</em> by <strong>Neutral Milk Hotel</strong> - I find both the
ridiculously high praise this album got the the early 2000s, and the backlash
it is experiencing in the early 2020s to both be a bit absurd. This is a
humble little lowfi psych pop record, no more, no less. Admittedly it is a
very good one, but the extremely high and low opinions expressed in thought
pieces published over the last 20 years, make me thing that I am missing
something or everyone else is. [<em>Memory</em>: I didn’t really connect with this
one until I listened to it on a run around a cinder track at my Junior High
School on a trip back to my hometown around 2010.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Aquemeni</em> by <strong>Outkast</strong> - Their last album that is still a clear product of
the rap sounds of that time. After this they would completely go off the map.
That said, this is one of the best records in late 90s rap, and the entire
genre’s history. If it wasn’t for some nonsense filler interludes, this might
be perfection. [<em>Memory</em>: It is hard to listen to this record and not think
about driving to and from State College, PA. I listened to this on my portable
CD player on many of those trips.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Yield</em> by <strong>Pearl Jam</strong> - This was where they were starting to become better
at ballads like “Wishlist” and gentle rockers like “Given to Fly” than the
uptempo rockers of their youth. Though this record does contain “Push Me, Pull
Me” which is one of the more underrated rock songs in their catalog.
[<em>Memory</em>: My co-worker bought this album and played it repeatedly after it
came out. Over time it completely reversed my opinion of their late 90s output
and would trigger my era of peak interest in the band.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>XO</em> by <strong>Elliot Smith</strong> - A master of smartly written pop gems, on this
record, he finally had the production values to really put everything
together. One of those records that I always forget how amazing it is until I
put it on. [<em>Memory</em>: This was one of the first records that I remember
listening to on my brand new iPod Nano in 2005.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Trading with the Enemy</em> by <strong>Tuatara</strong> - Somewhat of an indie super-group who
specialized in world music influence jazz fusion. The kind of thing that could
only happen in the 90s. They produced exactly this one great record, with the
rest of their catalog sorely lacking. [<em>Memory</em>: Yet another find from the
CD-R exchange at work. This was how I found music after commercial radio and
before the rise of the MP3.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Great Expectations (Soundtrack)</em> by <strong>Various Artists</strong> - The last of the
great compilation soundtracks in my opinion. They really don’t make them like
this anymore. At the time it was a curiosity as the solo debut of both <strong>Chris
Cornell</strong> and <strong>Scott Weiland</strong>. It also served as a mid-career reboot for
<strong>Tori Amos</strong> who took her singer songwriting to a more complex and upbeat
place that would anticipate her next few records. Sprinkle in some light
French electronica from <strong>Mono</strong> and we have a late 90s gem, and a great
farewell to an album format that was huge in the 80s/90s. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought
this record on the way back from a scholarship interview in Philadelphia. I
made a targeted trip to the Coventry Mall based exclusively upon the music I
heard in the trailer for the film. It turned out to be a fantastic record and
my point of entry to one of my favorite artists, <strong>Tori Amos</strong>]</p></li>

<h2>1999<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I guess if this project had a very beginning it would be this year. Sometime in
early 2000 I would assemble a mix CD of what I considered to be the best songs
of the prior year. I had recently bought my first CD burner, and one application
I was very excited about was the ability to create compilations that I could
listen to on the Sony Discman that was hooked into a casette adapter in my car.
It was a highly manual process that required me to insert and remove twelve
different albums as each track was added to the CD-R. So what was on
this disc, and how does it hold up 23 years later?</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/best_of_1999.jpg"><img alt="Old best of 1999 mix CD" src="../_images/best_of_1999.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<p>It could be way worse! Nine of the sixteen tracks come off of five albums that
are still among my favorites from the year. A further four songs make the list
of my favorite tracks off of records that are not on my album list. That means
that only three tracks have dropped off my radar completely, and they are a
study in how my taste has changed over time.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“No Leaf Clover” by <strong>Metallica</strong> - I don’t know that any other band has aged
less gracefully than these guys. What used to seem so edgy and hard, now comes
across as tacky and commercial. At the time I liked this track enough for it
to kick off the whole comp, but today it feels dated and boring.</p></li>
<li><p>“Higher” by <strong>Creed</strong> - This isn’t awful by any means, and it probably still
ranks as one of their best songs. In general I have no taste for the post
grunge sound anymore. There are a few selections on the list below that are
adjacent to this kind of thing, but I just can’t take all those distorted
droning guitars anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Chemicals Between Us” by <strong>Bush</strong> - Listening to this song again, it is a
bit more interesting than I remember. The structure is fairly ambitious for a
late 90s alt rock song, and it seems to be alluding to break beats in its
rhythms. That said, this band suffers from a bad case of crappy 90s guy
vocalist.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t even own all the albums and had to borrow two of them from a friend to
complete the playlist. This revealed to me another use of the CD burner, piracy.
For the next several years I would use this means to expand my collection beyond
what my current wealth could achieve. It was the age of music piracy after-all.
I had been experimenting with MP3 downloads for the last year or so when
high-speed internet all of a sudden made them way more practical. I remember
sitting in the computer lab of Penn State Berks campus filling up a 100 MB zip
disk a couple dozen tracks from Napster. Looking back, I wasn’t really
interested in pirating music, I just wanted a sample top make informed
decisions. We were using Napster like we use Spotify today. Regardless, by 2003
legal music downloads were finally a thing and I went completely legit. It isn’t
true of everyone, but I think the download era made me into the music consumer I
am today. I own 4000+ albums in different formats after-all.</p>
<p>Why was 1999 the first year when I decided to make a summing up of my favorites?
This was the dawn of the internet age, and there were a couple hand-crafted
websites out there already doing the same thing that surely were an
inspiration. For me though, it was something deeper. In late 1998 I had moved
out of my parents house. My summer internship was providing me a small amount of
discretionary income, and my discretion was to buy music. Specifically it was my
discretion to buy the music that interested me, all the music that interested
me for the first time in my life. Growing up in a conservative religious cult,
large swaths of pop music were considered evil, the work of “the Devil”. I was
mentally out of that mindset for some years, but the physical separation gave me
the freedom to explore my genuine self. Nowhere was this more tangibly evident
than the music I was consuming. Is this why pop music is so important to me? Because
in many ways it was the first medium through which I expressed and explored my
genuine self? I’m glad that so many of my favorites from that time are still
something I enjoy today. They have however been joined by quite a few others.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/1999.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 1999" src="../_images/1999.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>

<li><p><em>To Venus and Back</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - Her last album of the 90s and the end
of a period of massive artistic growth. It’s not that Tori has stopped
innovating after this one, but the rate of growing ambition slowed down a bit.
The originals on disc 1 take the electronic infused sounds from <em>Choirgirl</em> to
their logical and fulfilling conclusion. Some of the most exciting deep tracks
that still show up at live shows are here, like “Josephine”, “Suede”, and
especially “Lust”. The closing track “1000 Oceans” seems to point towards the
more straight ahead singer-songwriter material that would feature on the next
few records. Disc 2 is a stunning capture of Tori at her live best. At the
time it felt a little unnecessary, but today I’m glad we have this record of
the earliest days of full band Tori Amos performance practice. [<em>Memory</em>: This
is the first of three records on this list that came out the same exact day:
September 21, 1999. I’ll never forget heading to the Best Buy by my college
with a list of records to pick up. I was particularly interested in this one
as I had been buying the CD singles that had been released in advance of this
record. Each one seemed to be better than the one that came before. I remember
leaving the Wyomissing Boarders with a CD single of “1000 Oceans” and having
it unwrapped and ready to go in the discman by the time I got to my car. The
album did not disappoint. Soon after Tori would go on her dual headlining tour
with Alanis. I remember discussing with one of my work colleagues a plan to
somehow split the ticket to the Philly show, since we each only cared about
one of the artists.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>When the Pawn…</em> by <strong>Fiona Apple</strong> - Still my favorite record by her. The
eccentricity that would define her later work is starting to form, but has yet
to become grating. Certainly not a commercial record by any means, and it
pretty much destroyed her career for almost two decades. [<em>Memory</em>: This is
one of those records that I assumed that I would never own on vinyl. Thanks to
the success of <em>Fetch the Bolt Cutters</em> we got a really nice repress on Vinyl
Me Please in 2021. It cracks me up that they left the pretentiously long title
off the cover this time. I have to assume she is mildly embarrassed about that
as an adult.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Euphoria Morning</em> by <strong>Chris Cornell</strong> - A bit of a lost classic. After the
horrors of <strong>Audioslave</strong> and his later solo career it can be easy to forget
about this nice little 60s rock inspired record. In the late 90s it seemed
like every aging alt-rocker was leaning heavily on the psych-rock of their
youth. This was a nice showcase of his voice in a set of more low key
material. If only we had gotten more of this. [<em>Memory</em>: The second record on
this list from 21 September 1999. I was a fan of <strong>Soundgarden</strong> and enjoyed
his contribution to the <strong>Great Expectations Soundtrack</strong> and was very
interested in what his solo career would hold. I was very pleased with this
disc and the solo show I caught later in 1999 at the Tower Theater. After
that, I can’t say I enjoyed his work.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Implode</em> by <strong>Front Line Assembly</strong> - The beginning of their second phase.
Elements of techno and other modern electronic music are really starting to
creep in. This is massively danceable. The world music sounds of their other
act <strong>Delerium</strong> are also showing up more often. As an adult this is probably
my favorite of theirs. [<em>Memory</em>: I bought this on a bit of a whim during a
period of high interest in the <strong>Delerium</strong> project. In many ways, this was my
point of entry to the goth sounds.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Slow Riot for Zero Kanada</em> by <strong>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</strong> - Very much in
the sound of their debut LP, this EP is the perfect fit for when you want just
a taste of the <strong>Godspeed</strong>. Yeah it all sounds very much the same in
retrospect, but I like that sound. [<em>Memory</em>: IN 2021, when I was chasing down my
favorites from the past to make my vinyl collection as complete as I could, I
waffled on how much I really needed this. It ended up being the last record I
bought during that project.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The 3 Way</em> by <strong>Lilys</strong> - An interesting band that did a bunch of different
things, and released a ton of albums very quickly. I sought them all out, but
my favorite will always be this <strong>Kinks</strong> homage. The way that it fuses the
sounds from those late 60s records with the spirit of 90s indie is a magic
combination. [<em>Memory</em>: This was fairly obscure when I became aware of it in
the mid-2000s. I remember buying a used copy off of Amazon that didn’t even
have the front cover booklet. I now own an amazing 2019 vinyl pressing that I
am amazed got made.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Christmas</em> by <strong>Low</strong> - A remarkable holiday album that feels like an
incredibly natural thing for this band to create. It is warm and sad, and
complicated. It really captures the feeling of the holiday season for me and a
lot of other folks who consider it their seasonal favorite. [<em>Memory</em>: Around
2019 I started to compile a playlist of holiday music that captured the way
the season felt to me. I discovered this record when researching potential
candidates to add.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Secret Name</em> by <strong>Low</strong> - I don’t know that any other album lives up to the
genre of “slowcore” quite like this one. Beautiful music that moves along a
glacial pace. They hadn’t yet mastered their vocal harmonies (that would come
on the next one) but this has a delightful smallness they would never have
again. [<em>Memory</em>: I was listening to this a lot when I moved into the first
apartment I lived in alone. Everything was so quiet, and it felt a bit lonely.
This music really fit with that.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Play</em> by <strong>Moby</strong> - This guy was everywhere in the late 90s. This guy “is”
the late 90s. He might not be in fashion anymore, and actually is a bit hated
today, but this is still some really enjoyable pop-electronica. In fact, with
its break-beats, world music sounds, and epic production values, this might
sound more like the late 90s than anything else out there. [<em>Memory</em>: In the
summer of 1999 I took a trip to Niagara Falls with my brother, sister, and a
high school friend. As we waiting in traffic to get back to the hotel after a
fireworks show, I heard two songs I didn’t know on Edge102. They struck me so
much that I would start an email exchange with the station to find out what
they were. I would only have to wait a matter of days to find one of them
“Porcelain” from this record, when one of my coworkers brought it in and was
listening to it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>California</em> by <strong>Mr. Bungle</strong> - The last a best record from these guys. Their
throw everything at the wall approach didn’t generally create cohesive albums
that were enjoyable from beginning to end, but this one is. Heavy on the
doo-wap and surf rock genres, it also throws in bits of metal, noise and
rockabilly. The high points are the eclectic opener “Sweet Charity” and the
sweet pop of “Retrovertigo”. [<em>Memory</em>: Another record that makes me think of
the apartment I lived in by myself around 2005-07. This was my peak era for
listening to things that were highly rated on RateYourMusic.com. I think this
was one of the last CDs I ever bough from the Columbia House music club.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Fragile</em> by <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> - It is wild to think how big of a
production a hard rock record could be in the late 90s. We still have massive
overproduced albums, but they are by mainstream pop artists now, not outsider
electro-industrial outfits. This is one of those double albums that delivers
on its promise. You get the sense that Trent is no longer as lost or angry as
he is posturing to be, but man this is compelling stuff. The song “Please” is
an all time classic blistering NIN track, but once again many of the best
moments are quieter like the title track, “I’m Looking Forward to Joining You,
Finally”, and especially “The Great Below”. His finest work, and a top 5 all
time record for me. [<em>Memory</em>: This is the third of the records to come out
on 21 September 1999 to make my list. I actually didn’t buy this one on the
day of release, as I only had so much money to throw around. One of my good
friends did buy it, and put it on at a house party that weekend. I can
remember clearly listening to it on a boom box on the kitchen table and being
blown away. I ran out and got my own copy.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Gay Parade</em> by <strong>Of Montreal</strong>  - [<strong>1999 FAVORITE</strong>] - I really miss the
early incarnation of Kevin Barnes making weird little psych pop gems. This is
the peak of that sound, and a subtly profound mediation on the nature of
happiness. The Songs that close out the albums are especially profound. “My
Friend Will Be Me” is about finding the inner strength to fight back the
darkness of loneliness. “My Favorite Boxer” a set piece exploring the dangers
of finding fulfillment and meaning in a “relationship” with a media figure.
The cynical “Advice From a Divorced Gentleman to His Bachelor Friend
Considering Marriage” calls out the draining trap of negative thinking. The
stunningly beautiful “A Man’s Life Flashing Before His Eyes While He and His
Wife Drive Off a Cliff into the Ocean” shows how we often only realize how
good we have it when we are faced with it all being taken away. Then we have
“Nickee Coco and the Invisible Tree” who’s message is complex and completely
unclear. A young girl who becomes separated from her community seems to find a
place of peace and calm. Should we feel good when Nickee is found, or did she
really belong in that tree? [<em>Memory</em>: This was the first album I ever spent a
little more for a used copy of. For several months I watched eBay and
eventually put down $35 plus shipping for my own copy of the 1999 pressing. It
is funny to think about that as a lot of money now, since that is pretty much
the going rate for new albums. I remember a group of us were listening to
records on my old crappy Sony turntable in the basement game room of my
apartment in those days, and I dropped the disc on the floor! It survived.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Black Foliage Animation Music: Volume I</em> by <strong>The Olivia Tremor Control</strong> -
My favorite of the albums by the core Elephant6 bands. A fascinating, dark
sound collage, this is music of a particular mood. It makes very little sense
in daylight, or overly happy times. They only released two records, but they
were one of the greatest bands of the 90s. [<em>Memory</em>: I listened to this a lot
during the period where I was moving to Rochester around 2008/09. I remember
jamming it in a mostly empty office while I worked late into the night. It was
perfect for that environment. In 2010 the E6 bands played a holiday show in
Buffalo, and I enjoyed getting to hear several of my favorites off of this,
including the amazing “I Have Been Floated”.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Terror Twilight</em> by <strong>Pavement</strong> - For their last statement, they did
something a bit more refined, but not that refined. Given the change in
direction it isn’t surprising this was the end. A strong collection of songs
from one of the defining groups of the decade, and a blueprint that many of
the 2000s indie bands would mine for content. [<em>Memory</em>: I actually didn’t
know very much about this one when Matador released the vinyl reissues in
2010. I bought it to complete the set, and I’m glad I did.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Stupid Dream</em> by <strong>Porcupine Tree</strong> - The definitive statement of their mid
period, alt rock days. Some really interesting long-form rock songs with light
prog elements. The focus here was definitely the song-writing, and we got some
standouts, especially “Piano Lessons” and “Stop Swimming”. Mostly somber and
reflective in tone, this isn’t happy music, but it isn’t depressing.
[<em>Memory</em>: They were still and unknown band in the states when this came out,
and I only knew about it because of one of my friends from work who got it
from a friend back in his native Poland. I burned a CD-R off of him, and that
was my copy until I got the first official US release in the mid-aughts.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Home</em> by <strong>Sevendust</strong> - I listened to a lot of this kind of NuMetal thing
back in the day, but most of it hasn’t held up. The reason I keep coming back
to this is the vocals are a step above anything else in the genre. In addition
to the usual growling we have some really pretty <strong>Deftones</strong>-esque vocal
harmonies. This shows that a much maligned genre could be better. [<em>Memory</em>:
Every time I see that this album is on my list of favorites I question that
and think that it can’t be true. Then I listen to it, and realize that yeah, I
do actually like it quite a bit.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Agaetis Byrjun</em> by <strong>Sigur Ros</strong> - Ethereal beauty is the cliche way to
describe this one, but it is accurate. They feel like they have spent the rest
of their career trying to recapture this sound, and as a result have pretty
much kept duplicating this record. A dreamy atmospheric record for a winters
day. [<em>Memory</em>: I discovered this during a CD-R swap at my summer job in 2002.
I didn’t listen to it until I was back at my college apartment for the next
year, and I can still picture sitting in my basement room, listening on my PC
completely blown away by what I was hearing.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dysfunction</em> by <strong>Staind</strong> - Wow, what a time capsule of what music sounded
like back then. The rumbling low tunings, the growling. Oh yeah, this is
dated, and I have no idea why I am still listening to it almost 25 year later,
but I am. [<em>Memory</em>: I don’t believe in the concept of guilty pleasures, but
this one pushes that boundary. I thought long and hard about whether I could
put this on the list, but here we are.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>No. 4</em> by <strong>Stone Temple Pilots</strong> - A remarkable record that includes some
of the better grunge tunes these guys ever made (especially “Down”) while
continuing their development into more subtle territory with pop songs like
“Sour Girl” and “I Got You”. I don’t think these guys were appreciated in
their time, and this album really shows off their range. [<em>Memory</em>: This
album really makes me think of the Penn State Berks Campus that I attended
from 1998-2000. I was listening to this a lot on my rides into school.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Apple Venus Volume 1</em> by <strong>XTC</strong> - A truly exceptional record that feels like
the culmination of the 20+ year journey by these guys. A collection of ornate
pop gems, its not surprising they decided to stop here. This might the best
this kind of chamber pop can be done. Andy Partridge was writing 10 great
songs before breakfast in those days, and even Colin Moulding came up with his
ultimate statement in the stunner “Frivolous Tonight”. [<em>Memory</em>: When I
started to really get into these guys around 2005, this album had already
almost reached mythical status. Shortly thereafter I was able to actually buy
a copy when the <em>Apple Box</em> set was released.]</p></li>

<p><strong>Albums that dropped off during the project</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For some reason it took a really long time for me to be honest about myself in
regards to how much I actually like the first albums by <strong>Helmet</strong> and
<strong>Recoil</strong>. I guess I liked them back in the day, but they don’t hold up today.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Songs from Albums that Didn’t Make my List</strong></p>
<p>The 90s are the last decade where I like quite a few of the popular radio
singles of the day. There were also quite a few songs off of singles or less
successful records by my favorite artists.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“What’s Up” by <strong>4 Non Blondes</strong> - This has become the poster child for
embarrassing 90s alt rock. Holds up though.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Sign” by <strong>Ace of Base</strong> - Every decade has some killer Swedish pop.
This played several times an hour on VH1 in 1993.</p></li>
<li><p>“I Stay Away” by <strong>Alice in Chains</strong> - The first of several great tracks from
the ultimate “greatest hits” band of 90s alt rock.</p></li>
<li><p>“No Excuses” by <strong>Alice in Chains</strong> - Even better on their unplugged album.</p></li>
<li><p>“Rooster” by <strong>Alice in Chains</strong> - Sounds a bit goofy and over the top to my
adult ears, but I still dig it.</p></li>
<li><p>“Would?” by <strong>Alice in Chains</strong> - Their finest moment. If they could have
capture this kind of focus more often, they could have been so much more.</p></li>
<li><p>“Flying Dutchman” by <strong>“Amos, Tori</strong> - One of my absolute favorite songs was
supposed to be the last track on the double album version of <em>Little
Earthquakes*</em>. It instead gets to be the ultimate Tori rarity.</p></li>
<li><p>“Honey” by <strong>“Amos, Tori</strong> - This wouldn’t have fit on <em>Under the Pink</em> and
makes total sense as a B-side.</p></li>
<li><p>“Purple People” by <strong>“Amos, Tori</strong> - Still making spectacular B-sides at the
close of the decade.</p></li>
<li><p>“Sugar” by <strong>“Amos, Tori</strong> - Yet another great track left off of <em>Little
Earthquakes</em>. She had a whole album of B-sides that outdid most other artists
at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>“Take to the Sky” by <strong>“Amos, Tori</strong> - I made a playlist to simulate the full
original track list for <strong>Little Earthquakes</strong>. It is the greatest unreleased
album of all time.</p></li>
<li><p>“Upside Down” by <strong>“Amos, Tori</strong> - See above</p></li>
<li><p>“Poison” by <strong>Bel Biv DeVoe</strong> - <strong>New Edition</strong> split in four different
directions and dominated the charts of the day. This is the ultimate New Jack
Swing track.</p></li>
<li><p>“No Diggity” by <strong>Blackstreet</strong> - Everywhere in the mid 90s. I can finally
listen to it again.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Crying Game” by <strong>Boy George</strong> - Hard to separate this from the backwards
thinking of the context in which this was presented in Ace Ventura. A great
song when I do divorce it from that film.</p></li>
<li><p>“Motownphilly” by <strong>Boyz II Men</strong> - Essentially there theme song, and their
finest moment.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Distance” by <strong>Cake</strong> - What a strange and wonderful band. I strongly
considered putting <em>Fashion Nugget</em> on my list, but really it is mostly about
this track.</p></li>
<li><p>“Where the Wild Roses Grow” by <strong>“Cave, Nick and Kylie Minogue</strong> - What a
creepy video, but a great song.</p></li>
<li><p>“Gangser’s Paradise” by <strong>Coolio</strong> - I was really disappointed when I
discovered this is pretty much straight up theft of a Stevie Wonder song. The
original is a stunning work of genius, this track is a solid piece of
nostalgia.</p></li>
<li><p>“Paper Sun” by <strong>Def Leppard</strong> - A shockingly mature and effective track, well
after their peak years.</p></li>
<li><p>“Say My Name” by <strong>Destiny’s Child</strong> - I was very on board with this. I am
probably one of the few who was dissapointed with how <strong>Beyonce’s</strong> career
panned out.</p></li>
<li><p>“Counting Blue Cars” by <strong>Dishwalla</strong> - Kind of dumb but really enjoyable,
like the fanstastic album that would come next.</p></li>
<li><p>“Free Your Mind” by <strong>En Vogue</strong> - Another album that nearly makes my list it
is really just about two amazing singles though.</p></li>
<li><p>“My Lovin’ (You’re Never Gonna Get It)” by <strong>En Vogue</strong> - What an amazing
couple of singles, how did they fade away so quickly?</p></li>
<li><p>“Learn to Fly” by <strong>Foo Fighters</strong> - Another greatest hits type band that
never made a great album.</p></li>
<li><p>“My Hero” by <strong>Foo Fighters</strong> - See above.</p></li>
<li><p>“Killing Me Softly” by <strong>Fugees</strong> - Probably the best cover of all time.</p></li>
<li><p>“I Think I’m Paranoid” by <strong>Garbage</strong> - The best song you are likely to hear
on your PlayStation (Gran Tursismo 2).</p></li>
<li><p>“Civil War” by <strong>Guns N’ Roses</strong> - The big dumb epic from <strong>Use Your Illusion
II</strong> is by far the best thing from the album.</p></li>
<li><p>“November Rain” by <strong>Guns N’ Roses</strong> - The big dumb epic from <strong>Use Your Illusion
I</strong> is by far the best thing from the album.</p></li>
<li><p>“Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover” by <strong>“Hawkins, Sophie B.</strong> - Is this the most
90s of singles? It is hard to listen to this an not picture a coffeehouse,
plaid shirts, and VH1.</p></li>
<li><p>“Pardon Me” by <strong>Incubus</strong> - The beginning of their commercial turn, and their
finest moment in my opinion.</p></li>
<li><p>“This is How it Feels” by <strong>Inspiral Carpets</strong> - Rhino’s <em>Brit Box</em> connected
me to this gem of 90s psychedelic BritPop.</p></li>
<li><p>“Beautiful Girl” by <strong>INXS</strong> - A gentle moment was their last time in the
popular consciousness.</p></li>
<li><p>“Foolish Games” by <strong>Jewel</strong> - Delightful cheese. Memories of my freshman year
of college.</p></li>
<li><p>“”Right Here, Right Now””” by <strong>“Jones, Jesus</strong> - Another track that is so
early 90s, I am almost transported back to the mall.</p></li>
<li><p>“Constant Craving” by <strong>K.D. Lang</strong> - Hated it at the time, as an adult I
totally get the appeal.</p></li>
<li><p>“It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over” by <strong>“Kravitz, Lenny</strong> - I used to love this
guy, now I only really like his breakout hit.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Dolphin’s Cry” by <strong>Live</strong> - I also used to really like these guys, now I
only need this single track from the last days of their time of relevance.</p></li>
<li><p>“Vogue” by <strong>Madonna</strong> - It was an uneven decade for her, and this track was
probably the highpoint, and the end of her classic era.</p></li>
<li><p>“Motorcycle Emptiness” by <strong>Manic Street Preachers</strong> - An outstanding bit of
pop-punk that feels very light in comparison to what they would do in the
years ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>“Fantasy” by <strong>Meriah Carey</strong> - Mainstream pop music at its very finest.</p></li>
<li><p>“Fade Into You” by <strong>Mazzy Star</strong> - Anything could become massively popular in
the 90s, even this kind of moody indie rock.</p></li>
<li><p>“Carnival” by <strong>“Merchant, Natalie</strong> - Probably the high water mark of the 90s
VH1 fueled, adult contemporary renasiance.</p></li>
<li><p>“Uninvited” by <strong>“Morissette, Alanis</strong> - I never cared for Alanis, but she did
a great job singing this epic sountrack song.</p></li>
<li><p>“Alma Matters” by <strong>Morrissey</strong> - The second half of the 90s was a weaker
moment for the Moz, but each album produced a solid single.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Teachers are Afraid of the Pupils” by <strong>Morrissey</strong> - See above. Also the
Shostakovitch sample is quite effective here.</p></li>
<li><p>“Sunburn” by <strong>Muse</strong> - The one album where they are pretty clearly riffing
off of <strong>Radiohead</strong>, but to great effect on this track.</p></li>
<li><p>“Unintended” by <strong>Muse</strong> - They also produced a pretty good ballad on their
debut.</p></li>
<li><p>“Only Shallow” by <strong>my bloody valentine</strong> - I never saw this as a classic
album unlike a lot of people. Great opening track though.</p></li>
<li><p>“Regret” by <strong>New Order</strong> - An 80s band has their very finest moment in the
next decade. Nostalgia in song form.</p></li>
<li><p>“In Bloom” by <strong>Nirvana</strong> - I do not like this band as much as most people my
age. This poppier moment is my favorite song off of their studio albums.</p></li>
<li><p>“Don’t Speak” by <strong>No Doubt</strong> - The kind of top notch rock radio single that
doesn’t get made anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nothing Compares 2 U” by <strong>O’Connor Sinead</strong> - A lot of people think this is
the greatest cover of all time. Not quite for me (see <strong>Fugees</strong> above) but
pretty close.</p></li>
<li><p>“Harness Your Hopes” by <strong>Pavement</strong> - As I type this (2025) this song is more
popular than ever for some reason. A non-album obscurity that is one of their
finest moments, and a summary of what makes them great.</p></li>
<li><p>“Temple of Love” by <strong>Sisters of Mercy</strong> - This electro-dance track was their
last commercial single of note, and a great way to exit the mainstream.</p></li>
<li><p>“Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space” by <strong>Spiritualized</strong> - Sounds
way more like “Pachabel’s Cannon” than the dozens of other songs that uses
this chord sequence. (Including the one by <strong>Elvis</strong> that it also references.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Streets of Philadelphia” by <strong>“Springsteen, Bruce</strong> - I really liked this
song when it came out. I really like it now. One of the all-time great tracks.
Once of the all-time great productions.</p></li>
<li><p>“Save Yourself” by <strong>Stabbing Westward</strong> - Overly dramatic screaming
industrial, that holds up better than I would have thought.</p></li>
<li><p>“Here’s Where the Story Ends” by <strong>“Sundays, The</strong> - There was a really cool
kind of pop music coming out of the UK in the early 90s, that didn’t really
register in the USA. This is one of the top tracks from that time.</p></li>
<li><p>“Chop Suey!” by <strong>System of a Down</strong> - It was cheesy but very appealing at the
time. It is cheesy but very appealing today.</p></li>
<li><p>“Hunger Strike” by <strong>Temple of the Dog</strong> - I almost didn’t include this. I’m
kinda sick of it to be honest, but wow is it central to the time and place.</p></li>
<li><p>“There She Goes” by <strong>The La’s</strong> - Another great song from the early 90s UK
scene, that those of us in the USA didn’t know about until years later.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Kid’s Aren’t Alright” by <strong>The Offspring</strong> - In retrospect, these jokey
kids kind of look like pop geniuses. I only need this one from them though.</p></li>
<li><p>“Waterfalls” by <strong>TLC</strong> - Yeah they copied the lyrics from <strong>Paul McCartney</strong>,
but the song is a truly unique bit of Hip-hop/R&amp;B.</p></li>
<li><p>“If You Could Only See” by <strong>Tonic</strong> - Another of those outstanding pop-rock
radio singles that I will never tire of.</p></li>
<li><p>“Open Up Your Eyes” by <strong>Tonic</strong> - See above.</p></li>
<li><p>“Your Woman” by <strong>White Town</strong> - I’m not alone in believing this to be one of
the great “one hit wonder” tracks of all time. How did this get so popular
anyway? It is such a strange and wonderful track.</p></li>
<li><p>“Autumn Sweater” by <strong>Yo La Tengo</strong> - Another album largely thought to be a
classic, on which, I really only care for one song.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Origin Story As A Music Fan</strong></p>
<p>As I wrote out the text to go along with my 1990s favorites I realized that this
decade was also the story of how pop music became such an important part of my
life. I wanted to capture a somewhat chronological account of the path that led
me here, and the most fundamental moments in my developing taste.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Billy Joel</strong> - Like a lot of people who grew up in the mid-atlantic region
in the 80s/90s, Billy Joel played a big part in my life. Many of my earliest
memories of pop music revolve around the artist (more about that in the 1980s
section), and he was central to my pre-teen listening. By 1991, I had access
to most of his catalog across a range of formats (vinyl, tape, CD) in my
brother’s music collection. This cobbled together assortment became my
soundtrack to 6th and 7th grade. The two CD Greatest Hits was the central
cannon. Cassette copies of <em>Songs in the Attic</em> and <em>The Nylon Cannon</em> exposed
me to some of my favorite album tracks. I remember repeatedly listening to a
recording of a Philadelphia concert that my brothers had taped off of WMMR in
the early 80s. My absolute favorite was a cassette dub of my brother’s vinyl
copy of <em>Glass Houses</em>. In some odd way, the artist’s attempts at replicating
the New Wave sound on that record appealed to my nascent teenage yearnings. My
powerful lifelong connection with the song “All for Leyna” dates back to this
era. The vinyl record that produced that dub is now a cherished part of my
personal vinyl collection. I remember bonding with some of my middle-school
friends over a shared interest in the works of William Martin Joel, who at
that time was already generally seen as being very, very uncool. Because of my
unusual family situation, I often found it difficult to connect with my peers.
In the early 90s, in a very specific context, Billy Joel helped me feel a
little bit more normal than I usually did. Over the years I have found myself
continuing to connect with others over a shared interest in his catalog. He
will never be cool, but his pop songwriting has always been first rate. In a
way, he taught me to value substance over style. That approach has been
fundamental to my listening in the years since. The first CD I ever bought was
a fresh copy of my favorite <em>Songs in the Attic</em>. That copy now lives in my
brother’s collection, but it feels so right as the first album to enter my
collection. The first rock concert I ever attended was Billy at the Corestates
Center in Philadelphia in 1999. The first time I ever remember being excited
about a new release coming out was <em>River of Dreams</em> in 1993 (see the post
about that album for more details). I’m not too cool to admit that Billy is
fundamental to my relationship with popular music.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paul McCartney/The Beatles</strong> - Sometime around 1992 my brother had purchased
a copy of <em>Tripping the Live Fantastic: Highlights</em> by <strong>Paul McCartney</strong>. I
was initially resistant to what I perceived as old timer music, and he tried
to sell it to me as a logical extension of what my hero <strong>Billy Joel</strong> was
doing. I didn’t realize how ahead of its time that idea was, and today I am
one of many fans who sees Billy as the leading disciple of McCartney, and who
worked in the same aesthetic space for the entirety of his career. I was a
blank slate, and I remember being confused about what songs were <strong>The
Beatles</strong>, and which belonged to his solo catalog, and I had no idea what
<strong>Wings</strong> even was at this point. In the summer of 1992, I connected with the
record, especially the versions of “Hey Jude” and the “Golden Slumbers”
medley. In fact, “Golden Slumbers” made such a profound impression on me, that
I can vividly recall every detail of the moment where I connected with it. It
was a hot, sunny day and I had just taken a very cold shower after an
afternoon riding my bike around town trying to cool down in a house with
limited air conditioning. I sat in our living room listening on the five disc
Pioneer carousel changer that my parents had mated up to their early 80s era
Fisher Hi-Fi system. I was eating one of my absolute favorite snacks, an ice
cream float made from coke and inexpensive Weis Markets “Carnival” brand
vanilla ice cream. I remember getting up to open the magnetic glass door to
hit the back button to repeat the track multiple times. I had found something
wonderful that sounded like nothing I had ever heard before. The next year my
sister would buy the two disc selection of the month from the Columbia House
record club: Paul’s latest record “Off The Ground” and the hits compilation
“All The Best”. The compilation made a profound and immediate impact. The one
two combination of “Band on the Run” and “Jet” made a very strong case for the
merits of his solo career output. I was largely unfamiliar with the content of
the album (except the still fairly recent hit “No More Lonely Nights”) and I
was blown away by the quality of it all. The inner sleeve opens up to reveal a
photo collage of every McCartney solo work from the first self titled record
through <em>Press to Play</em>. I remember looking at that image fascinated by the
range of visual styles, and wondering about the sounds behind each of those
covers. “Off the Ground” also made a noted, but more subdued impact on me, and
I remember listening to the two records one after another on my brothers hi-fi
while I played Super Nintendo. The solo side of the equation had checked out,
and now I wanted to hear the source material that produced the Beatles tunes
that I knew from the McCartney live album that was my point of entry to this
world. I really wish I had a record of what order I purchased the Beatles
albums in, but I am fairly certain that I started by buying a copy of “Sgt.
Pepper” at the CVS Pharmacy at the Fairgrounds Square Mall in Reading
Pennsylvania. I remember that the record was 13 dollars, which was a
significant figure, since my brother had a personal policy of never paying
more than 10 bucks for a CD. That was certainly the album that pulled me in
and made me a fan for life. It is fitting since it is probably the most
McCartney-centric of their classic albums. It would set me on a path of
gradually acquiring their entire backlog and almost studying it as I went. A
year or so later (circa 1994) I would also start exploring the music behind
those album covers I saw inside the “All the Best” liner note booklet. Those
more obscure McCartney solo releases would require me to travel to the
outskirts of Philadelphia to visit the expanded collection of Tower Records, a
store that would be essential as my taste and record collection expanded in my
teen years. In many ways, we the 90s teens were the second Beatles generation.
So many of my friends were also deeply into their work and it became a way
that I bonded with many of the friends I made in middle school. I even had a
friend that shared my intense interest in the Paul McCartney deep cuts,
including albums that were borderline hated in those days like <em>Back to the
Egg</em> and some that are still panned today like “Press to Play”. The whole
thing culminated in the release of the <em>Beatles Anthology</em> documentary and
archival compilation CDs. The peak of my personal Beatlemania coincided with a
second wave of their dominance of popular culture, and synced up perfectly
with the culmination of my adolescent years. In 1997, I used the larval world
wide web to access a site called “The Flaming Pie Gazette” to read about the
recording and promotion of McCartney’s upcoming album. I had gone on a fairly
extensive musical adventure in the cycle between his studio releases. One that
would have a profound effect on my taste in music throughout my life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mid-90s Alt Rock</strong> - It wasn’t all Beatlemania for me in the mid-90s, and I
often would listen to the local classic rock radio station, 91.4 WYSP. In 1994
they would change format to the popular alternative hard rock of the day. I
was upset about the change, and was highly resistant to most of the music that
my middle-school peers were listening to by the artists of that day. This was
also around the time when 91.4 started broadcasting the home games by my
beloved Philadelphia Eagles. They played commercial bumpers that included
snippets of the music that made up their typical programming (I’ll always
associate “Machinehead” by <strong>Bush</strong> and “Long Way Down” by <strong>The Goo Goo
Dolls</strong> with Randall Cunningham, Eric Allen and the other stars of the day)
and I slowly became interested in these harder rocking sounds. I had become
curious about all of the mysteriously named bands that were being talked about
at school, and my teenage brain was becoming enticed by the sense of danger
that they presented. WYSP would introduce me to many artists that I still
enjoy to this day: <strong>Pearl Jam</strong>, <strong>Smashing Pumpkins</strong>, <strong>Nirvana</strong>, <strong>Stone
Temple Pilots</strong>, and <strong>Soundgarden</strong> appeared almost hourly on the playlist
and there was little time for acts beyond the core group. That said, for some
reason WYSP would also be where I would learn about one of my all-time
favorites, <strong>Morrissey</strong> when they played the somewhat off format track: “The
More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get”. This modern rock led me back to MTV for
the first time since my early days with cable in the late 80s. It was there
that I would become interested in the latest groups like <strong>Green Day</strong> and the
latest British import <strong>Oasis</strong>. While I’m no longer a big fan of their work,
those 90s English rock titans would be my window into the world of BritPop,
which would be highly influential on my listening for the next decade. For a
while I actually fell in with a group of middle-schoolers who liked to listen
to British music, use British slang, and generally engage in Anglophile
behavior. I remember one of them showed me a copy of <strong>The Stone Roses</strong> debut
record, which at the time, was a very obscure album in 1990s America.  I would
succeed in getting my sister to buy into a few of these artists, but generally
speaking this was music I wasn’t really allowed to listen to. It would be some
years before new technologies, and the freedom of my own money would allow me
to properly explore the alternative rock albums contemporary to my teen years.
As the years went by, it became more obvious how influenced many of these 90s
alt-rockers were by my favorite artist at the time, the Fab 4. We were the
second Beatles generation, not only because of those classic 60s albums, but
also the wave of 90s artists like <strong>Chris Cornell</strong> and <strong>Kurt Cobaine</strong> who
clearly were building directly on top of them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>David Bowie</strong> - In 1996 my brother purchased a new laptop computer. It was
the first PC that I had regular access to that had a CD-ROM drive. It came
with several CD software packages including the now legendary Encarta ‘95. The
digital encyclopedia provided access to a wide range of information that in
retrospect was almost a bite size preview of what we soon would be able to
access on the nascent web. I remember being fascinated by an encyclopedia that
went far beyond the sterile volumes of the World Book and Britannica, and
covered topics that felt downright hip and modern. I was particularly
interested in the article on rock music. It contained an interest survey of
popular music artists that touched on some of my favorites, and most
prominently featured David Bowie. Bowie was someone that I had general
awareness of. I knew his role in the Jim Henson film Labyrinth, and I
remembered his 1993 single “Jump” playing repeatedly on VH1 in the summer of
that year. I didn’t really have a high opinion of his work, but the 30 second
snippet of the song “Changes” featured in that Encarta article about Rock
Music changed all that in a moment. It faded in, featured the first chorus of
the song (chachacha…changes) and faded out as we reached the instrumental
break before next verse (…but I can’t trace time). It was mysterious,
wonderful, and unlike anything I had ever heard before. The Rock Music article
linked to a short article about the man himself, and I was blown away by the
idea of an encyclopedia article about a living popular musician. I remember
the article mentioning that he had developed and portrayed personas including
Ziggy Stardust and the Thin White Duke. I remember discussion of his
collaboration with artists like <strong>Mark Bolan</strong> and <strong>Iggy Pop</strong>. I remember
that it claimed he was a primary influence on <strong>Brian Ferry</strong> and <strong>Brian
Eno</strong> (is that true?). There was a picture of him sitting on a swing, which I
now know to be part of the elaborate stage setup for the mid-80s Glass Spider
Tour. There was discussion of his role of merging rock music with high
fashion, and his androgynous image. Some of this felt quite edgy and
dangerous, yet appealing to a young person who was already starting to
question the conventions of gender and the related cultural pressures. I
probably listened to that 30 second clip of “Changes”, yet Bowie still felt
very out of bounds and inaccessible to me. Interestingly it was once again
WYSP that expanded my horizons, when they reverted their format to classic
rock later that year. It was there that I would hear the song “Changes” in its
entirety for the first time. Hearing the song in whole, my impression was of a
much more conventional and even somewhat quaintly old fashioned tune. During
my next visit to the mall, I would dig in the B bin at The Wall where I would
find a copy of the compilation <em>ChangesBowie</em>. It had an interesting track
list that piqued my interest, but I was intimated by the collage of
photographs on the front cover showing Bowie in all his various images during
the years covered by the collection. Shortly after, I would find a two disc
singles collection on offer in the pages of the BMG Music Club brochure. It
would become my point of entry to the David Bowie catalog and the launch point
for my journey with my favorite artist of all time. Four very notable things
would occur in the summer of 1997. First, my brother and sister would both
move out, and as a result I would find myself exploring my own individual
tastes in things like music, less influenced by my older siblings. Second, I
would get my first summer job, leading to my own funds to buy things like my
own CDs, and my own Hi-Fi to replace the one that left with my brother. Third,
my dad decided to subscribe to American Online which brought a world of
information much larger than Encarta ‘95 to our family computer. Fourth and
least exciting, I would break my ankle in Late July finding myself with little
to do, other than listen to my music and research it on the web at 33kbps. I
remember after I got out of surgery to repair my ankle, lying down on my bed
and asking family to put on the album <em>Space Oddity</em> which I had recently
purchased to expand my Bowie collection. It was a perfect fit for that state
of mind. Two of my earliest internet memories are related to Bowie and date to
that summer of ‘97. First: I remember frequenting a fan site called “Teenage
Wildlife” (named after a song on “Aladdin Sane” I would not hear until years
later). They had a page for every Bowie song that included the lyrics and
notes/trivia. Users could leave their own comments about the song, and the
whole thing felt so futuristic at the time. I remember looking up a deep track
from <em>Hunky Dory</em> (my favorite album of all time at that point) called
“Quicksand”. The only comment on the song page was from a gentleman from
India, and I was blown away that I was having this connection over a
semi-obscure song with someone on the other side of the world. The early
internet was so positive and exciting. Second: the first video I ever played
off of the internet (well…the video I played as well as you could in those
dial up days) was the video to the new Bowie track “Little Wonder” which had
been posted to his official web page. Bowie was an early adopter of the web,
and a major advocate for the technology. Technology and David Bowie were
apparently a powerful combination in my life, and technology was only just
starting to influence and enhance my relationship with music.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tori Amos</strong> - She was the last artist that I discovered the old fashioned
way. In early 2008 I saw a trailer for the film “Great Expectations” and I was
very excited about the chill bit of electronic pop that it featured. Later
that day I had a trip planned into the city to do an interview for a
scholarship I was pursing at Drexel University. On the way, I stopped off at
the Bradlee’s department store in the Coventry Mall and found a copy of the
newly released soundtrack album. I remember looking at the track-list and
wondering if it was Tori Amos who was responsible for the song of interest. I
popped the disk into the portable Sony discman that I used in my car and
realized that Tori’s contribution “Siren”, was not the song in question, but
was something very different and wonderful. That mysterious bit of a piano
rock on one of the last great soundtrack albums was my my introduction to her
work, but it didn’t immediately make me dig further. In the physical media
era, exploration of music and the body of work of a newly discovered artist
moved slowly due to access and expense. A few months later, on the first nice
day of the spring, I was washing my purple 1997 Dodge Neon in my brother’s
driveway. I was spending a lot of time at his house my senior year in high
school, and I would soon move there to attend my first two years of college at
the Penn State Berks campus. A song came on the radio that was the lead single
from Tori’s upcoming album. That song “Spark” was in a similar art rock vein
to what I had heard on “Siren” but managed to be quite a bit harder rocking,
while still quite melodic and beautiful. I would purchase the album <em>From the
Choirgirl Hotel</em> soon after its release the following month. It immediately
became one of my favorite albums, and remains so to this day. I thought back
to the music video for “Silent All These Years” I had seen on VH1 years prior
(see 1992/<em>Little Earthquakes</em> for that story) and decided to try out her
debut record next. It was a stunning album, filled with deeply personal, yet
poetically abstract piano art-rock. By this point, I was very aware of the
famous fan page “A Dent in the Tori Amos Universe” which stepped me through
the very personal accounts of other fan’s journeys through the Tori Amos
catalog. By the end of my freshman year in college I owned not only her first
four LPs, but also various singles and EPs that contained essential B-sides
and deep tracks that were often some of her strongest work. Tori was the
ultimate cult artist, and her prolific, high quality output rewarded the
effort of seeking out this music. This felt like the kind of deep, artistic
music that I should be listening to as a college student, and I was proud to
project my fandom as a part of my personal image. When visiting one of my
friends in the dorms at school, I would come across the first other Tori fan
in the real world. That fan, named Scott, had the exact same Tori poster that
I had purchased at the campus fall poster sale, however his was in a massive
wall filling size. I remember us talking about our favorite deep cuts, and him
explaining to me how we were unusual since her fanbase was 90% female. I had a
general sense of this from my exposure to “The Dent” and other online
resources, but I really didn’t care, as I already was OK with going against
the conventions of gender Expectations. It was almost a default position of
much of the art I enjoyed. Tori would release her fifth album “To Venus and
Back” towards the start of my Sophomore year at Penn State Berks. I remember
going to the local record shops to pick up the 3-4 lead singles that would
come out before the full length. I have a very specific memory of buying the
“1000 Oceans” single at Borders, unwrapping it in the parking lot as I walked
to my car, shoving it into the in dash CD player I had recently installed in
my car, and listening as I rushed back for my afternoon classes. I was a bit
shocked by how conventionally sweet and heartfelt the song was, but it worked
perfectly as the closing track for the studio half of the album that would
finally release on September 21, 1999. (Interestingly two other of my
favorites would release on that same day <em>The Fragile</em> by <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong>
and <em>Euphoria Mourning</em> by <strong>Chris Cornell</strong>). That cycle between her fourth
and fifth full length records would perhaps be the most intense study and
exploration of an artist that I would ever undertake. It was also the last
time that old fashioned tools like the radio, soundtrack compilations, and
word of mouth would play a primary role in the process. In the middle of that
year, my Toriphile friend Scott clued me in on how I could get access to
Tori’s super secret first album <em>Y Kant Tori Read</em>. I had seen it discussed on
a VH1 clip show as an embarrassing over-reach for commercial success in the
late 80s. Tori fans, much like Scott were able to look past the 80s gloss and
see the first indications of the greatness to come. He told me to go to the
local independent record shop and ask them if they could get me “The Tori
album where she has the sword on the front”. When I went to the shop later
that day to do exactly that, I realized I was asking for a bootleg product. A
few days later they called me in and I was presented with a clearly somewhat
amateur product on a CD-recordable with printer paper cutouts for liner notes.
I always wondered if they made the copy themselves. That CD-R introduced me a
fun record that also now sits among my favorites and included yet more
outstanding Tori rarities as bonus tracks. That visit to Record Revolution
also introduced me to two additional concepts: the joy of shopping at funky,
hand-crafted independent record shops and the fact that you could still buy
vinyl records of new releases. They were only being made in small numbers,
mostly for independent shops like Record Revolution, but I saw 12 inch LP
releases of Tori’s first three albums, and various other records of the day.
For the first time I remember thinking how fun it would be to have my favorite
records on the format to really savour as I listened.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The First 400</strong> - In the summer of 1997 I used some of my first wages to
purchase my first hifi. It was comprised of a Kenwood tuner/amplifier, a pair
of Bose 201 bookshelf speakers and a 200 disc mega-carousel CD changer. By
this time I probably owned nearly 100 discs, but it felt like a lot of space
to expand. I was in love with the concept of having all my music available to
me at all times, and it felt like the next level beyond the 6 disc cartridge
changer my siblings used to manage their collections. Thanks to my first jobs
and the BMG/Columbia House record clubs, it didn’t take long for me to fill
that first player and buy a second that I placed on my increasingly impressive
hifi stack. I always wondered how long this would go on, and if someday I
would have a whole closet filled with these things. It wouldn’t take long for
the financial impacts of college and changing technology to render this whole
system obsolete. But for a while I lived in what I look back on as the first
400 era. It was always a bit of a struggle to keep track of what CD was where,
and to keep everything in an order that I was satisfied with. From the first
iteration, the changer sequence started with the Beatles albums in order and
then the Beatles solo records I had, then other major classic rock artists.
The second changer arrived around the time I started to buy more modern music,
and it became an arbitrary split between classic rock in changer 1, and modern
rock in changer 2.  I used to have “bump days” when I would insert new
releases in the appropriate place, and rearrange all the other discs to make
room. I kept a Microsoft Access database of each disc and its current location
to support the reorganization efforts, and to facilitate “pulls” when I would
refresh the contents of the leather CD wallet that I kept in my car.
Eventually that DB file would be transformed into a more flexible Excel
workbook, and eventually the Google sheet I have today. My collection would
later overflow those two changers, and I would simply list discs (or
downloads) as I would acquire them. What this means is that I know the order I
bought all my CDs in from about 2001 to 2011, but I do not know the exact
sequence in which I purchased that first 400. In a way, the first 400 are
almost like some sort of fundamental personal music cannon. My collection
hovered just below and above 400 discs for a fairly long period between the
years of 2000 and 2025, mostly due to changing finances and technology, but
also somewhat because of the bounding limitations of my hi-fi setup. It was in
the summer of 2021 that I would buy the first albums that went beyond the
capacity of those changers. I remember keeping them in somewhat chaotic stacks
behind the couch in my room on the second floor of my brothers house. I was
mostly living apart from my changers in State College at that point, and the
era of the first 400 was over. That said, it leaves behind a canonical
sequence that almost feels like a biblical account of my early listening.
Changer 1 starts with the big artists: <strong>The Beatles</strong>, <strong>Paul</strong> solo,
<strong>John</strong> solo, <strong>George</strong> solo, <strong>Ringo</strong>, <strong>Simon &amp; Garfunkel</strong>, <strong>Billy
Joel</strong>, <strong>Tom Petty</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong>, <strong>David Bowie</strong>, <strong>Pink Floyd</strong>, <strong>Led
Zeppelin</strong>, <strong>Def Leppard</strong>, and <strong>CSN(&amp;Y)</strong>. Then we have a sequence of
“classic rock era” greatest hits and best of compilations. Changer 1 continues
with a sequence of artists that I had only recently started to explore:
<strong>Steely Dan</strong>, <strong>Supertramp</strong>, <strong>Van Halen</strong>, <strong>The Who</strong>, and <strong>Yes</strong>. The
conclusion of changer 1 was the odd sequence of <em>Harvest</em> by <strong>Neil Young</strong>,
<strong>The Zombies</strong> <em>Greatest Hits</em>, and a two disc 70s greatest hits album.
Changer 2 starts with <strong>Tori</strong>, and then an alphabetical sequence of more
modern artists (e.g. <strong>Alice in Chains</strong>, <strong>Fiona Apple</strong>, <strong>Bush</strong> to
<strong>Suzanne Vega</strong>, <strong>The Wallflowers</strong>, and <strong>Weezer</strong>.). The split between
changer 1 and 2 is somewhat arbitrary, and the oddest inclusion in the “modern
rock” changer would have to be 70s prog rock giants <strong>Camel</strong> and <strong>Gong</strong>. At
the end of changer two is my collection of soundtrack albums, and my handful
of classical compilations. The first album to not get a home in the changers
was <em>Run With the Pack</em> by <strong>Bad Company</strong>. When I left for the fall semester
in the late summer of 2021, I did a “pull” of CDs using my printed out report
of the collection catalog, and I remember looking at the changers and the
growing pile of new purchases sitting in their jewel packs. I remember
wondering where this was all going to go in the years ahead. The truth was
that technology had already provided the answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MP3 Sharing and Napster</strong> - When my dad brought AOL into our house, one of
the first things I used the internet to research was pop music. I remember
going to a <strong>Billy Joel</strong> fan site that offered MIDI file downloads of many of
his most notable tracks. These files were approximate reproductions of popular
songs that used only a MIDI sequencer and instrument samples to produce a
fully instrumental, musak like experience. I was pretty impressed by this
rudimentary form of music at the time, and it offered me a way to listen to
music on my computer, and hear songs that I didn’t own in a more proper form.
There was a good year or so when I was collecting MIDIs from artist specific
fan pages, and the more comprehensive collection on the site “Vikram’s
Midi-Fest”. Over time I started to appreciate the performances as an art form
in itself. I appreciated the ability of the amateur musicians who were
creating some pretty impressive versions of these songs using fairly limited
tools. That said, I would completely loose interest in my MIDI collection when
I encountered a new technology towards the end of my senior year in High
School, the MP3 file. One of my friends started posting FTP links on his
personal website of low bitrate MP3 files. He also linked to a more
substantial collection hosted by one of our classmates (ironically someone I
didn’t get along with very well) that included many of the modern rock artists
(<strong>Soundgarden</strong>, <strong>Nirvana</strong>, <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong>) that my parents would have
been very unhappy for me to bring home from the record store. I learned how to
use an FTP client to make more direct simultaneous downloads, a skill that
would serve me well in the next phase of this journey. I dabbled in MP3s for
the next year or so, but it wasn’t until I got my first taste of higher
bandwidth in the freshman dorms that I could accelerate the process. On dial
up it would take the better part of an hour download a single track at a
somewhat decent bitrate. One of my college friends lived in the Berks dorms
and I asked to borrow his connection and offered to show him a path to
unlimited music exploration. In those days, there were websites that listed
FTP sites with login information where you could browse and sample other users
collections. Some of the sites had an upload vs download requirement that
meant you had to give them something to get something. They would post text
files of requests for what they were looking for. It was such a quaint start
to what was about to happen on a much larger scale. My process at this time
was to run an FTP client on a zip disc where I could save 90ish or so MB of
new files. I couldn’t host my own site from there, but I did keep a small
collection of some of my more desirable/rare tracks to share back. The whole
thing felt like a bunch of music fans sharing and exploring together, and
there wasn’t any indication of the reckless piracy that would soon follow. It
was also during that trip to the dorms that I realized that I didn’t have to
go out on the open internet to find much of what I was after. The dorm
residents were sharing an extensive collection of tracks on the local network.
This was how I met my Toriphile friend Scott, when I realized that he had a
significant collection of Tori rarities on offer. I still have some of these
files today as my only copy of some of her rarer tracks and my only remaining
downloads from the MP3 sharing era. The fall of my Sophomore year, my friend
Tony would introduce me to a whole new way to use that zip disc. We would sit
in the last row of the engineering computer lab and run a portable Napster
client uploading and downloading tracks to the most massive and diverse
collection of music the world had seen to date. I continue to believe that the
fundamental reason that Napster happened was a desire for accessability, not a
desire to steal. MP3 files provided rapid access to wide range of music that
went well beyond what we could hear on the radio, or find and Best Buy. The
files were easy to share with your friends, and play on your PC, the
consumption device those of us of college age were mostly spending time in
front of. It was the slow roll out of competing commercial paths to music
downloads that created the rampant piracy that would follow. For me,
downloading was mostly a path to music exploration, and I would want to buy
the CD copies of my favorites to hear the whole work at the highest possible
quality level. I would follow the winding path after the Napster shutdown to
sites like KaZaA, WinMx, and Limewire. WinMx is something that I remember
especially fondly since it tended to cater to connoisseurs like myself who
were interested in full album downloads of more obscure artists. In the short
term I do think that it did slow down my purchasing, particularly those
purchases where I was taking a chance on music that I wasn’t completely sure
about. It would be around this time that sites like CDnow would provide short
RealAudio snippets that would be the first steps towards accessibility and
empowering the consumer to make more informed purchases. As these capabilities
would roll out simultaneous to ubiquitous broadband access early in the next
millennium, my interest in MP3 sharing would erode greatly. That said, I have
no doubt that the access to a broad range of music provided by Napster and its
descendants would greatly expand my musical horizons and turn me into the
music super-consumer that I would be in the decade to come. That said, the
beginning of the digital music era also started the profound transformation of
how I engaged and consumed music. I was hearing more things more quickly, and
there wasn’t that motivation to try to engage with the physical item I had
acquired. I felt like I had performed deep study of the majority of the discs
in that first 400 of my collection, but now I wasn’t always taking the time to
dive that deep. I also didn’t have the physical record of my exploration. It
would become clear that I was going to need to extend effort to record and
remember that journey. A quarter century after that big shift in my listening,
I am using this site as a place to keep track of my listening and preferences.
For me, the process of exploring and consuming music is as important as the
favorites I discover, and why I am taking the time to create this archive. I
am the curator of my own musical history, and I want to have some record of
that curation process as it becomes less tangible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Important Threads</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>VH1</strong> - In the early 90s, MTV was well on its way to not being a channel
that played music videos. I remember being excited when we would vacation at
the Maryland Shore and I could actually watch videos on the newer VH1 channel.
At this time, they were still targeting a more “adult contemporary” audience,
but I was happy for anything I could get. The early 90s were a high point for
this kind of soft rock music, and I was OK with most of it (except Michael
Bolton, and there was lots of Michael Bolton). Having access to music video
television again on our 1991 trip was memorable enough that I can vividly
remember the trip when I look over a list of the Billboard top hits from July
of that year. Just a short time after, A new channel would appear on our home
cable connection with a static announcement that Video Hits One would be
joining our lineup. It would become regular viewing for me, particularly
during the summer vacation periods before I started working, the years
1992-96. In the late 90s VH1 would too transition away from music video
programming, but I also was very in to some of their programming from that
period including “Behind The Music” and “Pop Up Video”. I’ll always have a
soft spot in my heart for early 90s soft rock, and I can probably thank VH1
for that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hair Metal</strong> - The genre of music that have most enjoyed in my life that I
no longer really care for is probably the hair metal of the late 80s and early
90s. The second concert I ever saw in my life was <strong>Def Leppard</strong>, and in the
mid 90s I saw their work among my very favorite. I also really liked bands
like <strong>Bon Jovi</strong>, <strong>Poison</strong>, and especially <strong>Guns N Roses</strong>. As my music
tastes evolved, I just couldn’t see the same value in that relatively simple
music. Today I still have a lot of respect for <strong>Def Leppard</strong> as a highly
competent nostalgia touring act. <strong>GNR</strong> has had some great singles, but
largely their work hasn’t held up. As for the rest, I am very happy to leave
it in the past.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Record Stores of My Youth</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Strawberries</strong> - When I had my first money to spend on music this little
shop by the Jamesway department store was the place. The selection was
limited, but the prices were low.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Circuit City</strong> - In the 90s they used CDs as a loss leader, and had many of
the most popular new releases for far less than any other store. Their back
catalog titles were very limited, but I tried to get everything I could there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Downtown Records</strong> - My introduction to independent record stores. I
remember traveling to this funky little shop on High Street Pottstown with
some of my High School friends. It felt so exotic. It is still there today.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Wall</strong> - The place that offered the lifetime guarantee stickers, and
charged you 18 bucks for a CD in the mid-90s. I remember listening to new
releases on their headphone listening stations, but I only bought a handful of
albums there in my lifetime. I’ll always be able to know which ones those are
via those little blue stickers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tower</strong> - I’ll always vividly remember my first visit to the King of
Prussia location. They had a copy of pretty much every album I was aware of.
They had the entire catalog of artists. They had entire rooms dedicated to
Jazz and Classical music. It was always a treat when I got to visit this
place, and I would return with a stack of new disks. I remember seeing all of
the Paul McCartney solo albums I had seen in the liner notes to <em>All The Best</em>
and thinking about how long it would take to come back and own them all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Best Buy</strong> - In the mid 90s, this place felt a bit like Tower, but way
cheaper. When the location opened in Wyomissing, it became the location where
I bought 90% of the things I couldn’t get at Circuit City.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sam Goody</strong> - The last mall record store standing in SE PA would become an
occasional visit when I wanted an obscure new release, like the latest <strong>Tori
Amos</strong> CD single.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Borders</strong> - Oh man, I miss this place. It was perhaps the coolest chain
store that ever was. An amazing collection of Books, Movies, and Music it was
a place for nerdy teenagers (like me) to hang out in the late 90s. Boarders
introduce me to imported CD releases. Boarders introduced me to classical
music with the selections they played over the store speakers, and their
recommended recordings helped me build my initial collection.They were a
physical manifestation of the Amazon selection, it was too beautiful to live
into our modern age.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Record Revolution</strong> - My first visit was to buy a <strong>Tori Amos</strong> bootleg. The
unique vibe of the place would bring me back on multiple occasions before they
closed early in the next millennium. They put the idea in my head of returning
to vinyl records. It would take a decade before I actually started on that
journey, but it started here in 1998.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash Converters</strong> - The used CD era kicked into high gear in the late 90s.
This local second-hand sale chain had some of the best deals for used discs. It
was an especially good deal when they ran there regular buy 2 get 1 free
deals. I bought dozens of albums there for 2-3 bucks each.</p></li>
