<h1>2014 Albums<a class="headerlink" href="#albums" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This is it folks, the year “I got old.” I do feel like I made an attempt to
explore the new releases, and keep in touch with what was being covered in the
remaining indie music blogs. This is the last year I kept a Spotify playlist of
the things that I streamed for posterity. Interestingly, I feel like this is
also the year that indie music took a big hit in popularity and more mainstream
styles returned to prominence. That said, this is still a pretty great set of
records.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/2014.jpg"><img alt="My favorite albums from 2014" src="../_images/2014.jpg" style="width: 900px;"/></a>
<iframe allow="encrypted-media" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="380" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6LX6vr3idzHiTlDmHzqWDb?theme=0" width="100%"></iframe><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Everyday Robots</em> by <strong>Damon Albarn</strong> - A delightfully minimalist record that
feels like a variation on his other project <strong>The Good, the Bad, and the Queen</strong>,
this is what Albarn does best. “The Selfish Giant”” was probably my favorite
song from this year. He doesn’t get enough credit for his inventive piano
playing. [<em>Memory</em>: I remember being disappointed by most of the new music I
was hearing this year and latching on to this record in a very strong way]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Unrepentant Geraldines</em> by <strong>Tori Amos</strong> - This is where she entered into
that career phase where every album is perceived as a comeback. That probably
says more about the press and the general public not paying attention. Those
in the know, understand that there has only been on sub-par Tori Amos album.
That said, this is return to a smaller kind of songwriting, that was a clear
effort to do something different. [<em>Memory</em>: The record scared me a little at release, as
Tori felt like she was aging for the first time. It was as much about me as it
was her. Then I realized that Tori was showing her age only for effect. Her
voice was becoming weathered in a way that could be used for color. It was
just another tool in the toolbox.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>pom pom</em> by <strong>Arial Pink</strong> - It seems like everyone is converging on this
being the best release for this guy. It certainly is the most extreme
specimen, and that probably does make it the best. This is not subtle music.
“Picture Me Gone” is such a beautiful song and a relevant critique of social
media culture. [<em>Memory</em>: This album was a bit much for me when it first came
out, it took years for me to warm up to it.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Our Love</em> by <strong>Caribou</strong> - Another solid, understated electronic record from
Dan Snaith. I know this kind of music is still being made, but not nearly as
well as it was done here. [<em>Memory</em>: Pitchforks glowing review of this
actually made me not listen to it at first. That’s the way it was in those days.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ultraviolence</em> by <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong> - I didn’t take Lizzy Grant very seriously
until this record. I know that the production is what is pulling me in, but
there is some serious songwriting here as well. This was shocking at the time,
but it makes complete sense in retrospect with the sequence of fantastic
records that would follow. “Brooklyn Baby” is such a great diss track aimed at
the New York City hipster culture that rejected her. [<em>Memory</em>: Hearing the
instrumental second bridge in the title song for the first time was startling.
It was so beautiful and interesting.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Keys</em> by <strong>Hooray for Earth</strong> - This band had a very brief but highly
productive run. Only 3 years after their debut EP they released their finest
work here. The big guitars, the strong melodies, the delicate vocals,
the judicious use of electronics, and the
slick production that sounds increasingly like Toto. One of my favorite bands
of the late indie era, and their breakup almost was a signal that time was
over. [<em>Memory</em>: These guys always had a great promo video for the first
single on a new record, and “Keys” really got my attention]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Ambassador</em> by <strong>Gabriel Kahane</strong> - A concept album about his former home
of Los Angeles. This was the record where Kahane replaced Sufjan as my
favorite maker of “fancy folk music.” He is almost going prog here on “Empire
Liquor Mart.” The song “Villains” is great comic observation about how movies
and other media distort our perceptions of reality. [<em>Memory</em>: When this got
pressed on vinyl, I realized that the format was truly back]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Black Hours</em> by <strong>Hamilton Leithouser</strong> - When <strong>The Walkmen</strong> one of my
favorite bands of the indie era went on permanent hiatus I was bummed. I’m
glad this guy kept making music that was very in line with the sound of his
band, but with a mature sounds for his aging fans. This is a logical extension
of the strings and horn sound of the late Walkmen records. [<em>Memory</em>: Hearing
one of my favorite rock artists make this kind of music made me realize we
were both getting older]</p></li>
<li><p><em>Love Letters</em> by <strong>Metronomy</strong> - The Metronomy records can be organized into
two groups: The understated half-instrumental soundscapes, and the quirky pop
collections. This one is strongly in the latter class. “Reservoir” has become
one of their trademark songs, but it is only one of many pop gems here.
[<em>Memory</em>: I don’t know why, but I didn’t really “get” the band until this
album, which is one of their less popular]</p></li>
<li><p><em>This is My Hand</em> by <strong>My Brightest Diamond</strong> - A transition work between the
chamber pop that came before and the dance worthy tracks that would be next.
It is also the line between the woman who was Shara Worden but would become
Shara Nova. [<em>Memory</em>: I saw Shara for the last time on this tour. It was a
fantastic show in a small venue in Toronto]</p></li>
<li><p><em>In Conflict</em> by <strong>Owen Pallet</strong> - [<strong>2014 FAVORITE</strong>] The record where he
perfected the formula
that was started with the <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> records. While the music is
feeling more refined and perfected than ever before, the lyrics are a
stunningly transparent account of someone who is really struggling.
[<em>Memory</em>: I’ll never forget seeing the artist perform “The Riverbed” at
the 2014 Polaris Prize Gala]</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Innocents</em> by <strong>Weyes Blood</strong> - A much rawer, and sadder affair than the
music that would make her famous, but in my opinion, still her best work. I
love the records that have come since, but this is really special. This is the
kind of music someone can only make before they know what they are fully
doing. “Ashes” and “February Skies” are two of my favorite songs of all time.
[<em>Memory</em>: It is rare for me at this point in life to find a new favorite
artist of all time. When I discovered <strong>Weyes Blood</strong> and took a deep dive into
her catalog in early 2023 I found an artist that I really connected with. This
is by far my favorite of her work, and one of my favorite albums of all time.]</p></li>
