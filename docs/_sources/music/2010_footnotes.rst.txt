2010s Footnotes

Continued Explorations of the Past
----------------------------------

This was definitely the decade of my life when I was most engaged with the new,
but I still found some important pop music from the past. Here are the most
important ones:

- **The Divine Comedy** - One of my favorite new bands **Zambri** covered their
  classic song "Tonight we Fly" which got me very interested in their 90s work.
  Progressively I worked forward and now consider everyone one of their albums
  to be among my favorites, including four from this very decade.

- **Scott Walker** - Then **Divine Comedy** got me into this guy, one of their
  primary influences. His first four, self titled solo records became a big time
  favorite. Not surprising considering how much he has influenced my favorite
  artists of today and the past.

- **Chicago** - I have pretty much always liked these guys thanks to my older
  brothers. However, I typically drew a line between the records of the late 60s
  and early 70s (undisputed classics), an the late 70s and 80s stuff (at best a
  guilty pleasure). I learned to love most of it, even the cheesy David Foster
  produced stuff.

- **Kate Bush** - When I was in college, I gave *Hounds of Love* a try since it
  was regarded as a classic, and she is so linked to my all time favorite of
  **Tori Amos**. What I didn't realize is that I like her first four records way
  more. Thanks to Spotify radio, I now know this to be true. It played me
  "Wuthering Heights" and I discovered on through there, including what would
  become one of my all-time favorites, *Dreaming*.

- **The Beach Boys** - I knew about **Pet Sounds**, and I had some fun with the
  surf songs that came before, but I didn't fully appreciate their late 60s and
  early 70s records. That would change in the early years of the 2010s when I
  would become obsessed with records like *Wild Honey*, *Sunflower*, and *Surfs
  Up*. The whole thing would climax with the release of the *Smile Sessions* boxet.

Diving Deep into Classical Music
--------------------------------

I became an avid listener of WXXI Classical 91.5, and we are
very fortunate to have a classical station of this quality. I also went to
several dozen performances by our local orchestra and various chamber
ensembles. My biggest discoveries were:

- **Phillip Glass** - Who I went from knowing zero about, to consider one of my
  all time favorites. I saw a full performance of *Einstein on the Beach* in 2013
  and saw the composer perform some of his chamber music with **Eighth Blackbird**
  at MusicNow in 2012. I acquired and consumed a lot of his stuff, some of which
  will show up in my 70s and 80s lists.

- *The Glagolitic Mass* by **Leos Janacek** - Everything I like about my
  favorite composer, just a whole lot more of it. Plus a wild organ solo. I
  started out with the Kubelek recording, but settled on Sir Simon Rattle.

- *The Unanswered Question* by **Charles Ives** - Wonderfully creepy, and yet
  very beautiful. The story of struggling through life, summarized in a tiny
  little program piece. Greatest "20th century shorty" to start of an orchestra
  concert ever.

- *Symphony No. 2* by **Alan Hovhaness** - It is hard to imagine modern film
  music would be the same without this stunner. Such a warm, exciting piece of
  music. The Reiner/CSO recording is so definitive I feel like modern
  performances try to imitate it.

- *Symphony in D Minor* by **Cesar Franck** - An interesting symphony from the
  early 20th century that seems to anticipate minimalism with a unusually (for
  the time) repetitious form and gets its interest from variations of intensity
  and instrumentation. I've seen this performed live an unusual number of times
  and it has really sunk in.

- *War Requiem* by **Benjamin Britten** - I somehow have seen this monster
  performed twice (Both times with forces gathered up by the Eastman Music
  School for special performances) and a recording will never fully do it
  justice. A stunning, humongous work.

As mentioned above, some of my favorites from the decade were part of the so
called "indie classical" genre, or were outright classical releases that I felt
like I could include for some reason. That said, there are some pure classical
albums that I really enjoyed as well:

- *Recomposed: Vivaldi, The Four Seasons* by **Max Richter** - It is quite
  remarkable how he took music that I find quite boring and turned it into a
  favorite. He keeps the pretty parts, ditches the stuff that hasn't aged well
  and brings it all into the current age in a way that I really dig. [*Memory*:
  Around this time I was often streaming audio or video from WQXR of new
  performances arranged by their Q2 sub-channel. For a brief moment,
  contemporary classical felt so hip. They video-cast a great performance of
  this by the recomposer and soloist.]

- *Charles Ives: Four Sonatas* by **Hilary Hawn and Valentina Lisitsa** - Ives
  sensibilities work well in this intimate form. Love the way things shift back
  and forth from folk fiddle to 20th century weirdness. [*Memory*: I'm not sure
  how I found out about Hilary Hawn, but her punk-nerd image really makes me
  feel like this kind of music is for me.]

- *Processions* by **Daniel Bjarnason** - This is probably the most
  representative record I can point to for what folks were trying to label
  "indie classical". Music that wanted to build onto the established modern
  sounds to make something that had appeal to the masses. Something that dare I
  say might be described as "hip". [*Memory*: This makes me really miss Q2, they
  played this all the time.]

- *Song from the Uproar* by **Missy Mazzoli** - This built straight upon the
  first **Victoire** record to tell a story through Opera. Why does it get
  listed here, and not above, who knows? [*Memory*: I really regret not
  traveling to New York to see this performed. I always assumed this kind of
  thing would keep getting made. I didn't realize how brief this moment would
  last.]

- *Place* by **Build** - Not only was classical merging with rock, it was right
  up against the boundaries of jazz again. This is an outstanding classical
  fusion record? [*Memory*: Around this time I was checking out every new
  release by New Amsterdam records, and found a ton of great stuff. Shortly
  thereafter they pulled their music from Spotify, and it really impacted how
  closely I follow the label. Nothing illustrates better how fragile things have
  become in the streaming age.]
