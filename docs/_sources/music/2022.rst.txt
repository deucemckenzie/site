2022 Albums
-----------

Again, I feel like this project has had a significant impact on my listening for
the year. In this case, I wasn't seeking out new music as much as I focused on
assembling my favorites into as comprehensive of a vinyl collection as possible.
This was the year where I crossed the threshold of owning 80% of the records
captured here (82.3% and 848/1030 as I write this on 1 January 2023). That total
includes each of the nine records I enjoy from the year in question. I had a
really tough time picking a top favorite this year, and probably four of the
albums below are in a virtual tie.

- *Blue Rev* by **Alvvays** - So much of the best indie that is coming out today
  sounds like it is from ten years ago. It is too soon for this kind of thing to
  be nostalgia, so I assume that this kind of shoegazy, quasi-electronic indie
  is a genre unto itself now. They have done a great job with it here.
  [*Memory*: This year I did something I haven't done for the last few years,
  when I checked what the various music blogs and review sites were picking as
  the best albums of the year. I tried out a few things that sounded
  interesting, and this was the only thing that stuck.]

- *WE* by **The Arcade Fire** - Now this is more like it! I'm not sure what was
  going on during their prior record, but this is a massive improvement. Yes,
  there is some truth to the favorite joke that this sounds like the band trying
  to pay homage to their younger selves, but they are doing a great job! Best
  case scenario continues to be this band slowly morphing into Bruce
  Springsteen in the decades to come. [*Memory*: The first time I streamed the
  "Lightning I" single it was an exciting moment. Not quite like hearing
  "Sprawl II" for the first time, but the kind of joy only these guys can bring
  up.]

- *The Car* by **Arctic Monkeys** - [**2022 FAVORITE**] - The progression into
  more subtle, artier music has continued. So has my growing appreciation for
  their work. I had to spend some time with it, but I think this might be my
  favorite of theirs so far. A fascinating collection of lounge/soul inspired
  tracks, with several of their very best, especially the stunning "Body Paint".
  I can't wait to see where they go next. [*Memory*: I was more excited about
  the release of this record than any other in 2022. I really liked the last
  one, even if it went over most folks heads. With this album it looks like
  their maturing sound is starting to catch on.]

- *Once Twice Melody* by **Beach House** - It has become clear that all their
  records will be great, but some are greater than others. This is one of the
  top tier releases. More dreamy dream pop than we have seen since *Teen Dream*
  but with the crisp, first rate song-craft of a veteran who have mastered their
  art. [*Memory*: This was released in four 4-5 song increments, I ordered the
  deluxe vinyl box after the first play of the first batch.]

- *Ants From Up There* by **Black Country, New Road** - I'm always a little
  suspicious when something is so universally loved. Everyone from Amazon to
  RateYourMusic seems to think this is the consensus album of the year. When I
  listened to it, I was shocked that something like this was getting such wide
  acclaim. It reminds me of **Black Midi**, **Frightened Rabbit**, and **Thee
  Silver Mt Zion** (?!). I guess this is what the kids like now. [*Memory*: I
  really connected with this album for the first time on a walk around the Park
  Avenue neighborhood, particularly the song "Snow Globes".]

- *Imperium* by **Ghost** - They have changed the sound a bit again, but still a
  great record. Not as long lasting as their last two releases, but I still had
  a great time with this. "Darkness at the Heart of My Love" is a particularly
  interesting new direction for these guys. [*Memory*: I ordered a vinyl copy of
  this record before I heard a single song off of it. That is the faith I have
  at this point.]

- *Magnificent Bird* by **Gabriel Kahane** - The stellar folk song-craft we have
  seen in the prior records, with some interesting new elements and instruments.
  "Linda & Stuart" reminds me of Owen Pallett in a very favorable way. The title
  track feels like Gabe's take on the Sufjan formula, and it really works out.
  [*Memory*: I heard this record for the first time on vinyl, and I listened to
  it three times in a row.]

- *Ghost Song* by **Cecile McLorin Salvant** - I generally don't like vocal
  jazz, but I really like this. A great record of originals with a striking
  cover of **Kate Bush**'s "Wuthering Heights". [*Memory*: In 2022 I
  resubscribed to SiriusXM for the first time in about 15 years. Early on in the
  pandemic they offered free streaming, and it eventually made me join back up
  again. I heard the title track from this album on their jazz station and was
  really struck by it. ]

- *Laurel Hell* by **Mitski** - I had enjoyed several of her prior records,
  particularly *Puberty 2* but they were never consistent enough to make my
  list of favorites. I seem to like this one more than most folks. There is
  something about the use of piano and the dense arrangements that really speak
  to me. This is still a bit front loaded, but that first side is amazing.
  [*Memory*: This was another discovery on the satellite radio. The Indie
  channel was playing "Stay Soft" about every half hour and I was glad to hear
  it.]

- *And In the Darkness, Hearts Aglow* by **Weyes Blood** - Her albums keep
  getting brighter and more upbeat, though this one almost feels like it is
  doing it an a very tongue in cheek way. Really solid modern folk, with some
  really interesting indie electronic touches. One of the best artists active
  today. [*Memory*: This didn't do it for me the first time I listened, but it
  really, really grew on me. I didn't even include it in my original list of the
  best albums of the year. Now I'm questioning if it is my favorite from the year.]
