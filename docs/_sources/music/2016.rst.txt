2016 Albums
-----------

A significant portion of the music from this year was actually discovered during
my attempt to reconnect with pop music in the following year. The other albums
are all from established artists that I had be following for years. I'll
remember this year mostly for the passing of three of my favorite artists:
George Michael, Prince, and David Bowie.

- *Blackstar* by **David Bowie** - It is difficult to think about this record
  outside of the context in which it arrived. My pre-ordered copy showed up in the
  mail two days after Bowie, my favorite musician had died. It was so mysterious
  and exciting, but it was also the end of the story. Pop's ultimate performer had
  one last grand statement on the world stage, the big exit. Experimenting with
  new sounds until the very end, it is hard to imagine there will ever again be a
  musician who is both this massively popular and  yet committed to pushing
  the boundaries of pop music. [*Memory*: I used to spend time thinking about
  what it would be like when my favorite artists started dying, it happened so
  fast it almost doesn't feel real]

- *Foreverland*  by **Divine Comedy** - In my opinion, this is the weakest of
  the Divine Comedy records released to date, but it is still among my
  favorites. Neil Hannon feels very content here, and I think it is reducing
  some of the tension and contemplation that have made his previous work great.
  I actually own two vinyl copies of this, since my first one is signed by the
  artist, but I had to buy the reissue because Hannon's liner notes are that
  good. [*Memory*: When it became apparent I would own all the classic Divine
  Comedy albums as vinyl reissues, I panic bought the only copy of this in the
  United States on Discogs]
  
- *The Hope Six Demolition Project* by **PJ Harvey** - In 2016 we finally got
  the PJ Harvey saxophone record we had been waiting for. This record somehow
  feels like the capstone on what Polly has been up to for the last decade with
  her younger voice and harder sound rejoining her contemplative, social justice
  minded songwriting. I love the crazy aesthetic for this tour with Polly Jean
  dressed up in feathers playing in a chorus of saxophones. [*Memory*: I really
  wanted to travel to the UK to see the recording of this record which was
  presented in public as an art exhibition]

- *King* by **We are KING** - This was the record that brought my attention back
  to modern pop music. I have an annual tradition of watching the Grammy awards
  ceremony. Most years I hate nearly everything, but I like to stay in touch
  with what is going on in pop. I heard a snippet of "Red Eye" from this record
  during the presentation of the award for the "Urban Contemporary Album of the
  Year". This would put me on a path of exploration in what we now call
  "Alternative R&B" that continues to today. [*Memory*: I keep watching the
  Grammys hoping it will help me find other amazing music like this, so far not happening]

- *X-Communicate* by **Kristin Kontrol** - Kristin Gundred is a masterful mimic
  of the music of the past. Starting with her band **Dum Dum Girls** she
  excelled of mining the past without sounding totally derivative. Her first
  solo record manages to borrow liberally from late 80s Kate Bush, and 2010s
  synth pop, while adding just enough to stand up totally on its own. I really
  hope there will be another record from this project. [*Memory*: Being
  surprised that music like this was still being made, and getting high ratings
  from the likes of Pitchfork]

- *I Had a Dream That You Were Mine* by **Hamilton Leithouser** and **Rostam** -
  This record ended up sounding like the combination of **The Walkmen** and
  **Vampire Weekend** that it seemed like it would be on paper. This is aging
  hipster music done right. [*Memory*: A person on a social VR platform
  (AltSpace) playing this for me excitedly, and dying under mysterious
  circumstances days later]

- *Mass Gothic* by **Mass Gothic** - In what was a big theme to my middle 2010s,
  this album is some of my favorite artists of the previous decade moving on to
  their next project. In this case, the husband/wife duo from **Hooray for
  Earth** and **Zambri** teaming up to make some delightfully poppy noise rock.
  "Every Night You've Got to Save Me" is a stunning single that shows off what
  these underrated musicians can do. [*Memory*: The mixed emotions of a great
  new band, but the loss of two that were a bit better]

- *blond* by **Frank Ocean** - [**2016 FAVORITE**] A stunning concept record by 
  one of the best
  artists working today. My vinyl copy of this record is an amazingly made
  bootleg, because the real thing is worth over 400 bucks these days. Ocean
  seems intent on only being so popular, almost choosing artistic relevance 
  over fame. It is hard to argue with the results. "Nights" might be the best
  song of the last 10 years. [*Memory*: Actively seeking out a bootleg for the
  first time to have a physical manifestation of one of my all time favs]

- *Tigarello* by **Phonte** and **Eric Robertson** - Nothing says where my head
  is at these days than this album of rap songs about the bliss of  monogamy 
  and settling down. Hip hop for rapidly approaching middle age. [*Memory*: This
  album makes me feel really old, and I don't care]

- *Jessica Rabbit* by **Sleigh Bells** - These guys are making some great tunes
  completely under the radar. I wish the hipsters that were buzzing about this
  band at the start of the decade were still paying attention. This is some
  surprisingly complex, rocking stuff. [*Memory*: ]

- *Front Row Seat to Earth* by **Weyes Blood** - A transitionary record between
  her earlier dark, psychedelic folk and the brighter electronic infused indie
  that came later. Her voice isn't quite perfect yet here in a way that sounds
  great. Stunningly beautiful music. [*Memory*: I know I heard this on NPR back
  in the day and thought about checking it out. I didn't discover her until
  around 2022 and she has become one of my all-time favorites.]
