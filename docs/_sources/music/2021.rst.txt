2021 Albums
-----------

This is the first year that was compiled with this project in progress, and in
mind. How did this impact my listening? The impact is subtle, but I'm sensing an
effort to branch out and hear new things (that aren't just random things I'm
hearing on NPR). By the time 2021 ended, I had been working from home for
almost two years. I'm also seeing the kind of introspective music that fit in
well with that kind of isolation. I also feel the effect the pandemic on a sense
of isolation and self reflection in many of the records I was listening to.

- *The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows* by **Damon Albarn** - I
  really didn't like this the first time I heard it, but it really grew on me.
  Such a pretty, subtle record. [*Memory*: I liked this record well enough to
  seek out a vinyl copy, and it was really only after the first listen that way
  that I really connected with this one, especially the last few tracks.]

- *Ocean to Ocean* by **Tori Amos** - Another really strong record, from an
  artist who keeps making them. Probably not as good as *Native Invader* but the
  song "Spies" is her best in a decade or more. [*Memory*: Tori came to
  Rochester for the first time in about 20 years on this tour and played a great
  show to a very engaged audience.]

- *Cavalcade* by **Black Midi** - My favorite artist discovery in some years.
  (More than a decade maybe?). Some serious prog/math rock made with an indie spirit.
  So pretty, so dense, so much to wrap your head around. The kind of music that
  only makes sense to people with hundreds of favorite records, and hand craft a
  website to talk about them. [*Memory*: buying the LP online before I had even
  heard half the album because I was so taken]

- *Jubilee* by **Japanese Breakfast** - We are now getting to the point where
  music is starting to sound like a retro throwback to the indie music I
  listened to in my college days. This is the kind of semi-twee indie pop that I
  loved 20 years ago, updated with the electronic sounds of our current age.
  [*Memory*: Around this time, It felt like every time Spotify radio took over
  after the music I actually chose to play, it played me the song "Paprika". Did
  this make me like the album by brute force?]

- *Chemtrails Over the Country Club* by **Lana Del Rey** - *NFR* wasn't a fluke,
  but the beginning of a career on a whole new level. This is another extraordinary
  album filled with the old Lana tricks and a killer folk soul. The songwriting
  is top notch, and the performances are first rate. My favorite artist working
  today. [*Memory*: It had been about five years since I had heard an album on
  vinyl for my first listen, and I was glad I saved this one]

- *Blue Banisters* by **Lana Del Rey** - How is this even better than her first
  album from 2021. How is she the most consistent artist of the current
  generation? What is the next album going to be like? Is it coming out this
  year too? [*Memory*: Being extremely confused about what this was when it was
  announced a few weeks after *Chemtrails*]
  
- *Solar Power* by **Lorde** - Yes, this is a much subtler record with less lofty
  themes and goals. We live in an age where subtlety doesn't get the credit it
  deserves. This is a great record. Don't worry, I'm sure she will be back to
  some real melodrama someday soon. [*Memory*: For the second straight record I
  hated the lead single when I heard it, but I love the album (and ended up
  liking the lead single in time)]

- *Hey What* by **Low** - [**2021 FAVORITE**] - When I became aware that these
  guys were making somewhat avant garde electronic music now, I had to hear it.
  Sure enough the beautiful harmonies were now backed by a super interesting and
  downright pretty interpretation of minimalist industrial. Are they really
  Mormons? Surely music this good must be sinful? [*Memory*: In a repeating
  theme this year, I bought a vinyl copy of this midway through my first listen]

- *Tomorrows III* by **Son Lux** - Continuing my Star Wars analogy from last
  year, this is most definitely "Return of the Jedi" and "Embrace" is "Yub Nub"
  brining the whole thing home with a positive vibe, looking back on the themes
  that run through this amazing trilogy. [*Memory*: Streaming this first thing
  the morning it was released and feeling so satisfied by how the trilogy ended]

- *The Future Bites* by **Steven Wilson** - I dig the sterile, anxious vibe of
  this record, even if the songs aren't universally brilliant. Certainly music
  for our current age. The singles "KING GHOST" and "PERSONAL SHOPPER" are
  killer. Who here is surprised that this guy has changed sounds again?
  [*Memory*: The creepy video for "PERSONAL SHOPPER" is all I can think of when
  I hear this album]
