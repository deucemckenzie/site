2019 Albums
-----------

This year holds the distinction of me having the fewest favorite albums from
the years I lived through first hand. There is no question I was
almost completely disengaged from looking for new music. I spent a lot of time
listening to the local classical music station, and some time looking backward
thinking about the project I am working on here.

- *Norman Fucking Rockwell* by **Lana Del Rey** - [**2019 FAVORITE**] This was 
  the only album that I
  discovered and fully engaged with during the year of 2019. I like all of
  Lana's albums, but this one is stunning. The songwriting has gone to a new
  level, and she has really separated herself from her peers working in the the
  crowded female singer songwriter (with a large support team) space of our
  current era. "Venice Bitch" and "Hope is a Dangerous Thing for A Woman Like Me
  to Have, but I Have it" are her two finest songs so far. [*Memory*: All of a
  sudden the world was on board with Lana, and I'm feeling ahead of the times]

- *Office Politics* by **The Divine Comedy** - No act played a bigger part in my
  late 2010s listening that Neil Hannon and company. I had largely stayed away
  from the newer records, as I was for some reason convinced that their best work
  was back in the 90s. I especially avoided this record due to that horrendous
  cover making it look like some sort of comedy record. Hannon has always gone
  right up to the line of being a "joke band" but has managed to stay in the
  region of witty, ornate chamber pop. This record was a pretty big departure
  musically, with a broad range of styles, and has the most humor we have seen
  from him in over 20 years. I was wrong to be suspicious, this is an exciting
  reinvention and an indication of a bright future. [*Memory*: That cover is
  awful, I avoided the record for almost two years as a result]

- *Forever* by **Metronomy** - When I heard this back in 2019 I immediately
  loved the song "Sex Emoji" but didn't really get the rest.  This is one of
  Metronomy's more difficult albums, and it took some time to warm up to the
  more intricate, atmospheric electronic parts. [*Memory*: Feeling disappointed
  that I didn't like this at first, because I was getting into so little new
  music at the time]

- *Motion* by **Rone** - Somewhere between electronic music and contemporary
  classical, I love this kind of thing. I have my Spotify weekly recommendations
  to thank for this one. Good job Spotify! This is technically a long single,
  not an album. This is how little music I've heard from 2019, that I need to
  count this. [*Memory*: Hearing this on Spotify recommendation radio and
  immediately loving it]

- *Titanic Rising* by **Weyes Blood** - A terrific folk infused indie record
  with an artist with a stunning voice. Probably the kind of music **Joni
  Mitchell** would make if she was born in the late 90s. [*Memory*: It really
  bothers me that I discovered this when Spotify radio kept playing me
  "Andromeda". They were right, I love this. It just feels wrong that they are
  having so much influence on my tastes now.]
