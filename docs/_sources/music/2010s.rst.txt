2010s
=====
This was an interesting decade for music and for my relationship with music.
When it began, we were at the point I like to call "peak indie" where a
collection of small labels were releasing the most culturally relevant albums,
and the big labels were trying to pretend they were the small labels in order to
compete. I was writing for a local music blog, and attending multiple large music
festivals per year. These were mostly the (now rare) club festivals that were
spread out among multiple small venues over several days. These were the kind of
festivals that demanded research and study to attend properly. I loved the
process of reading about all the bands, getting ahold of a sample of music, and
laying out my plan to rove about the clubs to catch my favorites. The tee-shirts
and vinyl records bought from merch stands at these shows are now staples of my
wardrobe and album collection today.

When the decade closed, mainstream pop from the major labels had returned as the
dominant force in the music scene. It had never really went away, it was more
that independent music receded to the shadows again. I have nothing against
mainstream pop, as my lists for earlier decades show. My objections mostly have
to do with the impacts of how modern pop music is made. Today, your average pop
single is written and produced by a committee of dozens. When that many folks
contribute to the creative process it has the effect of sanding every edge off of the track by the time
it reaches the finish line. Any remaining distinguishing characteristic was so
intentionally created, it can't help but feel contrived. I haven't been to a
music festival since 2013. That last one was the inaugural "Crossing Brooklyn
Ferry", a combination of the most high brow indie combined with artists that
typically get labeled as contemporary classical. The rest of the decade, 75% of
the live music I saw was the local symphony orchestra, This was where "I got
old", but where exactly did it happen?

2018
----
I think the best summary of this year is that all of these albums, except for
two were by artists that were among my favorites going into the year. Those two
new artists were both discovered on NPRs All Things Considered.

- *Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino* by **Arctic Monkeys** - Of all the bands to
  come out of the early 2000s post punk revival, these guys have stayed the most
  interesting for me. All the genre hopping on this one put a lot of people off,
  but it is why I still care about them.

- *7* by **Beach House** - The name is a reference to this being the seventh
  record, all of which are among my favorites of all time. It feels a little
  weird to me that my favorite modern band is a two person dream pop act. There
  are a lot of familiar sounds on those seven records, but it never gets old.

- *Prequelle* by **Ghost** - After the last record, I was really hoping for more
  power ballads along the lines of "He Is" and we got them, and it was great.
  "Life Eternal" does such an amazing job straddling the line of comic theatrics
  and beautiful sincerity. Some killer rocking tunes too (e.g. "Rats").

- *Merrie Land* by **The Good, the Bad, and the Queen** - Somehow I missed the
  release of this album, and didn't find out about it until two years later.
  Their self titled record was one of my favorites from the last decade, and
  I thought it was a one off project. Like the first one, this album is a big time grower
  that takes a bit to get into. Given the passing of Tony Allen I assume this is
  the last one, but it already feels like a bonus that we have this.

- *Book of Travelers* by **Gabriel Kahane** - I saw Kahane perform this album
  twice, the first of those as a multimedia performance at BAM. The story of his
  cross country train trip looses something without the little stories he told
  between songs, but it is still a beautiful set of melancholy little folk
  tunes that reminds me of those great performances.

- *I've Tortured You Long Enough* by **Mass Gothic** - Now sounding like a
  direct merger of their former bands **Hooray for Earth** and **Zambri** I am
  very much sold on this project. I'm really pleased that Jessica Zambri is now
  singing most of the songs as it suits the style better somehow.

- *Little Dark Age* by **MGMT** - After their highly disappointing, self titled
  third album, I had given up on these guys. I can usually sense when a band has
  lost the sound that made me enjoy them in the first place. When they came back
  with this strong release out of nowhere it was the surprise of the decade for
  me. They did it by finding their way back to their old sound. Sometimes
  regression is a good thing.

- *Dirty Computer* by **Janelle Monae** - This album has been influenced by the
  sounds of highly manufactured, modern pop music. At first it was shocking and
  disappointing from an artist who seems to transcend that kind of thing.
  Eventually I was able to find the things that make Monae one of my favorites,
  and I can appreciate this for what it is: a way above average implementation
  of 21st century pop idioms.

- *Soil* by **serpentwithfeet** - NPR discovery 1 of 2. I love when the sounds of
  church music are adapted to a more honorable purpose. A former choirboy turned
  Satanist makes a gorgeous record of queer love songs.

- *Brighter Wounds* by **Son Lux** - A fitting place between two new NPR
  discoveries, for an artist who owes their career to NPR. That early public
  radio fame has led to one of the strangest bands to have a fairly large
  following. Their second record as a legit three piece band, they are really
  testing the limits of their audience with this challenging record. "Forty
  Screams" is such a complex, stunning opener for an album that never quite
  matches that opening intensity.

- *Heaven and Earth* by **Kamasi Washington** - I love jazz fusion (as is clearly
  evident by my 1970s favorites). There isn't much good fusion being made today,
  but Washington gave us three whole disks worth here. His band is killer and I
  particularly enjoy the vocal contributions of Patrice Quinn (and I normally
  hate vocal jazz). NPR discovery 2 of 2.

- *Dirt* by **Yamantaka//Sonic Titan** - I bought my vinyl copy of this record
  from Alaska B, the leader and only consistent member of this art metal band.
  She was surrounded with an almost all new assortment of Montreal musicians
  who had taken the band in a new, much heavier direction.
  The show was at BugJar, the tiny indie club down the street from my house. It
  was incredible to see such loud music in such a small space, what a night.

2019
----
This year holds the distinction of me having the fewest favorite albums from
the years I lived through first hand. There is no question I was
almost completely disengaged from looking for new music. I spent a lot of time
listening to the local classical music station, and some time looking backward
thinking about the project I am working on here.

- *Norman Fucking Rockwell* by **Lana Del Rey** - This was the only album that I
  discovered and fully engaged with during the year of 2019. I like all of
  Lana's albums, but this one is stunning. The songwriting has gone to a new
  level, and she has really separated herself from her peers working in the the
  crowded female singer songwriter (with a large support team) space of our
  current era. "Venice Bitch" and "Hope is a Dangerous Thing for A Woman Like Me
  to Have, but I Have it" are her two finest songs so far.

- *Office Politics* by **The Divine Comedy** - No act played a bigger part in my
  late 2010s listening that Neil Hannon and company. I had largely stayed away
  from the newer records, as I was for some reason convinced that their best work
  was back in the 90s. I especially avoided this record due to that horrendous
  cover making it look like some sort of comedy record. Hannon has always gone
  right up to the line of being a "joke band" but has managed to stay in the
  region of witty, ornate chamber pop. This record was a pretty big departure
  musically, with a broad range of styles, and has the most humor we have seen
  from him in over 20 years. I was wrong to be suspicious, this is an exciting
  reinvention and an indication of a bright future.

- *Forever* by **Metronomy** - When I heard this back in 2019 I immediately
  loved the song "Sex Emoji" but didn't really get the rest.  This is one of
  Metronomy's more difficult albums, and it took some time to warm up to the
  more intricate, atmospheric electronic parts.

- *Motion* by **Rone** - Somewhere between electronic music and contemporary
  classical, I love this kind of thing. I have my Spotify weekly recommendations
  to thank for this one. Good job Spotify! This is technically a long single,
  not an album. This is how little music I've heard from 2019, that I need to
  count this.
