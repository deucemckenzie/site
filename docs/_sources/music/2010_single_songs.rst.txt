2010s Single Songs
==================

I listened to a ton of music. Much of it was great, even if the album it came
from wasn't a favorite. Also, the rise of streaming had given elevated
importance to singles again. As I mentioned earlier, my favorite song of the
decade *In Kind* by **Braids**, was an amazing single that got put on a sub-par
record. Here is an unordered, list of other songs that I really like
that are not contained within my favorite albums:

- "Genghis Khan" by **Miike Snow** - Soundtrack to the last days of AltSpace (actually not)

- "Ancient Ways" by **Interpol** - Saw them at Royal Albert hall soon after this

- "Face for Today" by **Duran Duran** - Out of nowhere back to pop relevance

- "Uncle ACE" by **Blood Orange** - Love that sax part at the end

- "Keep Your Lips Sealed" by **The Do** - France's answer to **Sleigh Bells**

- "Shell Games" by **Bright Eyes** - Last song I love by this guy

- "Rivers and Roads" by **The Head and the Heart** - Why can't they have more
  like this?

- "Bizness" by **Tune-Yards** - I can't take her music in long doses, but this
  is great.

- "December" by **The Constellations** - Thanks to WITR I know about this weird song

- "Adult Goth" by **Gang Gang Dance** - Saw these guys at Pitchfork and they had
  a comical, new agey performance style straight out of the 90s

- "Midnight City" by **M83** - "The City is my Church!, bb" - RIP Hipster Runoff

- "Polish Girl" by **Neon Indian** - I much prefer the first album, but a great single

- "Cheerleader" by **St. Vincent** - The last song of her's that I love

- "We Are Young" by **Fun** - Yeah this is pop trash, but it is great pop trash

- "Smile (Pictures or It Didn't Happen)" by **Amanda Palmer** - Terrible person,
  great song

- "Live" by **Ultravox** - What an amazing song for these guys to end an amazing
  career on

- "Spiteful Intervention" by **Of Montreal** - The last song I love by this guy

- "Past Life" by **Lost in the Trees** - The smoother sound of this record
  didn't really work, except on this one

- "Sears Roebuck M&Ms" by **Ava Luna** - Another nutty, but extremely catchy
  song from a band that is completely off the map

- "Fall in Love" by **Phantogram** - Electro-pop masterpiece that they have
  never quite been able to reproduce

- "Front of the Line" by **Magik*Magik** - I only know about this woman because
  of her orchestral performances at noise pop, but glad I could hear this gem

- "Fireworks" by **Mitski** - By far my favorite song from the first three
  of her records

- "The Lung" by **Hiatus Kaiyote** - Thanks Spotify radio!

- "Laura" by **Bat for Lashes** - Such a powerful song, and I wish she would do
  simpler arrangements like this more often

- "Paper Love" by **Allie X** - Apparently the Canadian answer to Lorde, I know little else

- "Scared Money" by **NxWorries** - The kind of Chillwave/R&B mix that I wish we
  had more of

- "Abducted" by **Cults** - I remember the aura around these guys at NxNE 2011
  as the next big thing, but they leave behind this amazing track and "Go Outside"

- "Pizza Pasta" by **Night Manager** - Absolutely stunning, like everyone of the
  two dozen or so songs they leave behind

- "Shut You Down" by **Caveman** - Probably my favorite band from this time to
  never produce a great record, but this song is amazing

- "So Good at Being in Trouble" by **Unknown Mortal Orchestra** - They were
  mostly a singles band for me, including this one

- "Disparate Youth" by **Santigold** - One of the last songs I remember
  discovering from a commercial (for some sort of car)

- "Black Diamond I/II" by **Ava Luna** - A nutty combination of soul,
  traditional indie, and **Nine Inch Nails**?!

- "Death Rays" by **Mogwai** - Finally something different, more of this please!

- "Where'd ALl the Time Go?" by **Dr. Dog** - Every now and then these low-fi
  revivalists find a really great song
