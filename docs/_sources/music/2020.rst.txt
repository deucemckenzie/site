2020 Albums
-----------

The lost year. The most historic year most people now living will experience. A
massive pandemic that impacted everything. A relationship ended, an exciting new
one began. I changed jobs from one I loved, to a new one I loved more. I had
more free time that I have ever had as an adult. I didn't hear a whole lot of
new music I loved, though I certainly tried. I'm still mostly getting into
albums by artists I already know well.

- *The Loves of Your Life* by **Hamilton Leithouser** - I've enjoyed each of his three
  solo records released to date, but each one sounds more and more like his old
  band *The Walkmen* and I'm not going to complain. I loved *The Walkmen*.
  [*Memory*: Being excited there was any new music to listen to during the pandemic]

- *McCartney III* by **Paul McCarney** - In the depths of early pandemic anxiety I
  was really excited to hear about the third in the series of McCarney's self
  titled records. I and II had been some of Paul's most experimental and
  groundbreaking work. I pre-ordered on vinyl the day it was announced. It
  managed to be better than I thought it could be. I listened again when I wrote
  this, and realize I am still liking it more with each listen. It is remarkable
  that he can make music like this at his age and career state. [*Memory*: Hearing
  that this existed was welcome good news in one of the roughest periods of my life]

- *Tomorrows I* by **Son Lux** - [**2020 FAVORITE**] - Another welcome
  distraction in the lost year was the three part epic by Ryan Lott and band.
  The albums play out more like films in a trilogy than a multi-movement musical
  piece. This one does a great job setting up the themes and concepts of the
  whole work. [*Memory*: This was released right after I moved back to
  Rochester] 

- *Tomorrows II* by **Son Lux** - If part one was A New Hope, this definitely is
  Empire Strikes Back. Everything is shaken up and broken apart. The reviews I
  saw didn't like this one. I don't think we were supposed to be comfortable. This is the
  middle act in the trilogy when things get harsh and difficult. [*Memory*:
  Being very disappointed with this until part III resolved everything]

- *The Ascension* by **Sufjan Stevens** - I'm glad that Sufjan is back to making weird
  music, that is when he is at his best. [*Memory*: For some reason I listened
  to my vinyl copy of this  for the first time while watching a video of my high 
  school class Promenade on Facebook]

- *It is What it Is* by **Thundercat** - Not as perfect at his previous record *Drunk* but
  still an amazing record on the boundaries of R&B and jazz. [*Memory*: I spent
  a really long time deciding if I really needed a copy of this on vinyl,
  apparently I did]
