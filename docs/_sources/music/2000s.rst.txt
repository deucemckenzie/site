2000s Overview
--------------

This project includes albums from a span of 66 years, and over one quarter of
them are from the 10 year span covered on this page. One of the interesting
things about being born in the first year of a decade is that the phases of my
life align with the decades in a very direct way. This is the music of my 20s, a
time of great personal development, and the time when I connected with pop music
most deeply. It was the rise of hip-hop and indie. It was a time when disruptive
technologies changed the way music was made and sold. It was a time when the
innovators started to break from the mainstream of pop music, but the internet
still helped them find an audience. I'm glad that I got to be young, but not too
young in such interesting times.
