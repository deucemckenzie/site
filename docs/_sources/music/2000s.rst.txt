----

When I look at the picture below I'm struck by how many different ways I
discovered these records. Some of these were the latest releases from acts I had
been following for some time, but mostly they were completely new things. There
are songs I heard on Sirius or XM satellite radio. There are things that were
the hot albums on the indie music blogs of the day. There were small indie
releases that were recommended by eMusic. There are 3 (!) albums that I
discovered watching a UK music countdown show, repackaged as cheap filler
content on the obscure US Cable network, HDNet. There is a album with a track I
heard on a iMac commercial. Some of these were the top records on RateYourMusic,
back when tastes were a little different there (more indie and mainstream). I
was still using the AllMusic guide to do genre studies (in this case post-rock).
There is an album I ran out and bought on the drive home from the local brewpub,
where I heard it playing in the background.

This is also the year where I have by far the most releases that I would like
to own on vinyl that I do not. In many cases, these records never saw a vinyl
release, and are obscure enough that one is not likely to ever happen. As a
result, there is quite the unsightly stack-up of CDs on the side of the image.
This almost encapsulates the unsightliness of the CD as a format. The art is too
small to be appreciated, and no matter how well you tried to take care of those
jewel cases they are scratched up and a little cracked. Many of those discs were
bought at City Lights Records, where I had started to shop when my old favorite
store, Mike's Movies and Music had closed. Many came from Amazon, in some cases
imported from the UK (a new practice that I had adopted). One of these CDs, was
imported from the UK by myself personally!

More than anything I'm looking at the image below and feeling powerful waves of
nostalgia. This was the music of my younger self. A person I can relate to, but
no longer completely am. I glad that I can always revisit my former self though
these albums.

- *Beach House* by **Beach House** - Listening to this is quite startling
  knowing the band they are today. This is a much smaller, slower, and
  meandering record than what they do now. This slight record was certainly
  enough to get me interested back then, and I still really like it today.
  [*Memory*: I found out about these guys as an eMusic recommended artist. I
  remember Greg at city lights being impressed how ahead of the scene I was that
  time. I also remember buying my vinyl copy at Amoeba records in San Francisco
  in 2009 and being surprised that they were making vinyl reissues of relatively
  recent indie records.]

- *The Life Pursuit* by **Belle and Sebastian** - It is hard to remember now,
  but this was a controversial record when it came out. The transition to
  straight ahead pop they had started on their previous record was now complete.
  Everyone missed the half-folk and chamber elements, and it was widely regarded
  as sub-par. I really enjoyed these back to basics pop songs back then, and
  now consider this their finest record. This was also the album when Stevie
  Jackson and Sarah Martin really started to play a larger, and quite welcome
  role in the band. The mix of the three primary vocalists had become the
  signature sound of the band. It was almost like they had become a more twee
  and gentle **New Pornographers**.

- *Let's Get Out Of This Country* by **Camera Obscura** - The Scots understand
  indie pop like no other nation on earth. This might be the finest record in
  the whole genre. Back when hit indie records were a thing, this was one of the
  biggest. Everywhere from Pitchfork, Stereogum, NPR Music, and Spin wanted you
  to listen to this thing. Every service recommended it as a download, and it
  climbed the RateYourMusic charts in a way music like this can't anymore. Holds
  up. [*Memory*: This was the first real concert I attended in Rochester, NY. I
  remember walking down the German house in 2009, and being excited that I could
  see bands like this in the town I lived in. This would be the beginning of
  three great years of shows.]

- *The Crane Wife* by **The Decemberists** - This was the start of a new phase
  for a band that always liked drama, but now were completely centered on
  telling grand stories. A little preview of the proggyness that would fully
  form on the next one, this was still mostly the indie-folk of the first three
  records. This whole record tells a story that I've never been able to follow,
  but it doesn't matter because the songs are so strong. A great guest spot by
  **Laura Veirs** on "Yankee Bayonet" as well. [*Memory*: I remember this being
  voted the top album of 2006 by NPR listeners and feeling a little bit old that
  my tastes aligned with that group. It isn't my favorite from the year any
  longer, but it is close!]

- *Victory of the Comic Muse* by **The Divine Comedy** - After a couple more
  serious records, Neil Hannon allows himself a little levity again. One of the
  very last of his records for me to warm up to, it joins the rest of the
  catalog as a favorite. He is probably the most consistent artist I know of.
  [*Memory*: I think I had only heard this once or twice before buying the
  entire vinyl reissue series.]

- *The Bright Lights and What I Should Have Learned* by **Duels** - A late entry
  in the UK indie scene, it is a mostly guitar based Brit-pop derivative sound
  with a sprinkling of the keyboards the USA kids were getting into. I think it
  was because this sat uncomfortably between UK indie and the contemporary
  mainstream sound that this didn't really find an audience despite being a
  really crisply put together record with some interesting sounds. Weirdly, this
  sounds a bit like the kind of "mindie" music that was about to become very
  widely popular in the USA. [*Memory*: I found out about these guys by watching
  "London Live" a repackaging of a UK countdown show that was filler material
  for an early HDTV channel called HDNet. The performance of  the song "Animal"
  had an really fresh, dance-able sound that seemed to anticipate what was about
  to come in North American Indie.]

- *Tuesday Wonderland* by **Esbjorn Svensson Trio** - In the 2000s jazz
  experienced a new kind of fusion, this time with indie and experimental rock
  music. These guys made several of the most important records in the movement.
  The startling **Radiohead**-esque "Fading Maid Preludium/Postludium" bookends
  a set of music that is only slightly more in line with conventional Piano
  jazz. The releases after this would get a little too difficult for me, and
  this is the one where the balance between artistry and accessability was most
  to my liking. [*Memory*: I was spending so much time looking for music, that a
  fairly obscure record like this one was coming at me from multiple angles. A
  featured album by NPR music, I was also hearing this on the Beyond Jazz
  channel on XM radio. I think one of the reasons I like my favorites so much
  from this era, is that I really picked them from a large number of things I
  had heard.]

- *S/T* by **Electric President** - One of the records that followed on from the
  gentle indie-electronic sound of **The Postal Service**, but this one was much
  slower and more somber. I also like how these guys played around with song
  structure, there are bridges and unexpected transitions everywhere. This was
  really interesting stuff that never found the audience it deserved. [*Memory*:
  I had been a subscriber to Sirius Satellite radio since the summer of 2003,
  and it had become a primary influence on my listening. I had always heard that
  XM had a much wider playlist, but didn't really have a full appreciation until
  I heard some XM jazz programming during an Orange Bowl trip in early 2006. I
  immediately subscribed upon my return, and "Good Morning, Hypocrite" from this
  record was one of the first tracks I heard on their indie station, XMU. I can
  almost still picture that song title in the saved track list on my portable
  XM receiver sitting on the dash of my old Purple Dodge Neon. I miss the old
  XM.]

- *Bitter Tea* by the **Fiery Furnaces** - This is one of those records where I
  never understood the prevailing opinion. Somehow this is perceived to be the
  impenetrably difficult and dense follow-up. If anything this takes the
  experimentation and proggy-ness of **Blueberry Boat** and adds back in the
  strong pop component of the early stuff. Things like "Waiting to Know You" do
  an amazing job balancing the weirdness with the sweetness. I like this record
  way more than 95% of the human population. [*Memory*: This was the time when
  you could buy an unpopular record on vinyl at a steep discount. I don't know
  if I even paid 10 bucks for a nice new copy of this.]

- *Just Like the Fambly Cat* by **Grandaddy** - It took me a while, but I came
  to appreciate the last record from the first tenure of these guys. Some
  serious punk aggression (especially on the hardcore homage "50%") has been
  added to the usual low-key, often downtrodden psych-pop. This would have been
  a great statement to end on, and I haven't liked what has come since nearly as
  much. [*Memory*: I listened to this a lot on headphones around the time I
  lived in my little Park Ave apartment. I still like to crank it through cans
  every now and then. The fuzz sounds great that way.]

- *Yellow House* by **Grizzly Bear** - I didn't like this very much when it
  first came out to great acclaim. I connected much more with the next record,
  which featured far more conventional songs. I think after I had that blueprint
  to follow, I could better appreciate this more abstract work. [*Memory*: This
  was strangely difficult to hear for a massive indie hit. It wasn't on eMusic,
  and I don't recall ever seeing the CD appear at City Lights (or Best Buy). It
  was also out of print on vinyl for a shockingly long time, until I got the
  re-issue that came out in 2022.]

- *Knives Don't Have Your Back* by **Emily Haines** - [**2006 FAVORITE**] - A
  stunning piano based singer-songwriter record, that is completely unlike
  anything else I have ever heard. I really think she saves her very best stuff
  for the rare solo releases, and this outclasses anything from **Metric** by a
  fair margin. The production on this record is quite exceptional as well, and
  the dreamy mix really adds a lot to the impact of the top notch lyrics.
  [*Memory*: I became aware of this album via a post of the excellent video for
  "Doctor Blind" on Pitchfork. The artist is strolling through an empty
  department store in a creepy scene that really complements a fairly profound
  song about the over-prescription of anti-depressants.]

- *The Day I Turned to Glass* by **Honeycut** - A delightful anomaly: hip hop
  influenced indie rock made by a classically trained cellist. I don't think
  this ever found its audience, and I'm not sure it really has much of one. I
  really like it though. Listening today, it sounds a bit ahead of it's time and
  it fits in well with what is going on in the frontier of R&B. [*Memory* I
  discovered this ]

- *Howling Bells* by **Howling Bells** - I had been enjoying this record for the
  better part of a year when someone pointed out to me that it is a bit of a
  country record. They were right. It is dark kind of country made by
  Australians, but country nonetheless. This was back when the Bella Union label
  seemed like it was trending towards some sort of modern day 4AD, and this fits
  right in with that. "Setting Sun" is one of my favorite songs of all time.
  [*Memory*: I really struggled to acquire this record. This was another band I
  discovered on HDNet's "London Live" show. Their performance was a little
  rough, but I liked it enough to DVR it and watch it over and over again. I
  remember waiting for a 2007 US release that didn't happen, and I couldn't find
  a way to import the disc from the UK on Amazon. Eventually I would buy a copy
  from HMV on my first trip to london in March 2007 and hand carry it back to
  the USA myself.]

- *Return to Sea* by **Islands** - I like this even more than the much loved
  **Unicorns** LP, as the more serious tone does it for me. Plenty of whimsey
  still here, but the epic indie-pop of "Swans (Life After Death)" was a welcome
  expansion of the wounds used by that prior band. Even "Rough Gem" manages to
  be silly in a far more epic way. This is big indie-pop. [*Memory*: Another XMU
  discovery, the expanded playlist of my new satellite radio service was
  expanding my music collection.]

- *Silent Shout* by **The Knife** - The kind of music only Scandinavians can
  make properly. Creepy atmospheric, yet highly melodic and certainly not the
  least bit danceable. This is the electronic music of calm reflection in a dark
  room. [*Memory*: This was the first time I can remember resisting a Pitchfork
  hype record out of principle. When I finally relented, it was very clearly an
  amazing record.]

- *Everything Wrong is Imaginary* by **Lilys** - The Elephant6 adjacent band
  from Philly ends on a very high note. The superior of the two records to come
  out of their third phase. The sharply produced shoegazy indie-pop on offer
  puts to shame the myriad of new bands working in this territory at the time.
  [*Memory*: After this record came out I assumed it was the start of a glorious
  comeback for this guy. I didn't realize it was the end.]

- *Someone to Drive You Home* by **The Long Blondes** - Very derivative of the
  long history of post-punk and new wave, but the execution is perfect. In
  retrospect this can almost be seen as the period on the post-punk revival.
  This is where the new wave revival and imaginary 80s began. [*Memory*: I have
  always been unable to process exactly how much I like this record for some
  reason. When it was getting good press back in '06 I was so resistant to it.
  When I reviewed my candidates when making this list, I was tempted to leave it
  off. After half a listen I was rushing off to find a vinyl copy on discogs.]

- *Pretty Little Head* by **Nellie Mckay** - Another double album genre
  experiment, this time on an indie label, where this belongs. Less white girl
  rapping, and what remains is well done. The genres here are more looking back
  on Broadway and cabaret music, with some alt rock thrown in. [*Memory*: One of
  the first records I remember buying on eMusic. It was very surprising to see
  her on an indie, though it certainly made far more sense than this kind of
  thing being on Columbia. I had started using the eMusic platform in 2006 and
  its subscription based buffet was becoming very influential in my tastes.]

- *You Are There* by **Mono** - Post-rock was a very tired scene by 2006, and
  these guys were one of the last great bands to emerge. Somewhere between the
  shimmering guitars of **Explosions in the Sky** and the chaotic strings of
  **Godspeed You! Great Emperor** maybe the last listenable combination of
  elements left to cover. Their finest record, with their definitive track
  "Moonlight". [*Memory*: This album, and particularly the track "Moonlight" was
  one of the great rediscoveries while making this list. I streamed it during a
  morning walk during a review of the albums on the bubble for the year. I
  probably streamed it half a dozen more times that day.]

- *Black Holes and Other Revelations* by **Muse** - This was the record that
  would finally break these guys in America, more due to better promotion than
  any shift in sound or quality. Still very big alt-rock music, with perhaps a
  bit more of the **Queen** style theatrics. The hit "Supermassive Back Hole"
  introduces a funky kind of groove that would hit at the broader template that
  would be used in the next few records. Looking back, this probably was the
  peak of their first era, and it makes me a little sad since I don't like their
  new direction quite as much. [*Memory*: Another time when I got to feel a bit
  ahead of my time thanks to the expanded playlist of satellite radio.]

- *Bring Me the Workhorse* by **My Brightest Diamond** - I became aware of Shara
  Nova through her work with **Sufjan Stevens** and **The Decemberists**, which
  led me to her solo catalog. Her debut is a subdued, and often moody record. At
  times it feels like a gentler, more classically trained **PJ Harvey** album.
  I don't listen to this as much as her later work, but it is still a great one.
  [*Memory*: In the early days of my vinyl collecting, I could still buy back
  stock first pressings of records that weren't big sellers. That is how I got
  this one around 2010.]

- *He Poos Clouds* by **Owen Pallett** - I became aware of this record on the
  Pitchfork best of 2006 list, so I gave it a download on eMusic. They compared
  it to **Andrew Bird**, but aside from the violin, I don't know why. This is
  some very out there, art-rock that is heavily influenced by contemporary
  classical music. I liked bits of it at the time, I love it now. A complex and
  difficult album, and a first class performance and recording. [*Memory*: This
  along with **Shara Nova** was my gateway into contemporary classical. It was
  very sneaky how they got me to accept the complex sounds by wrapping it in pop
  songs.]

- *Writer's Block* by **Peter, Bjorn, and John** - "Hey Google, play the hipster
  whistling song." This was the first time that an indie artist made a song that
  felt like it was designed for commercials. This was the genesis of mainstream
  indie (or mindie as Carles liked to call it). That does nothing to tarnish an
  outstanding indie pop record, and really it only helped to elevate the status,
  and increase the production of great indie-pop records. [*Memory*: I heard
  (the now legendary) "Young Folks" for the first time when it was playing in
  the background of Otto's Pub and Brewery, my hangout at the time. I stopped at
  Best Buy on the way home, hoping to find a CD copy. I came home with what
  would become one of my favorite records of the year.]

- *We Are the Pipettes* by **The Pipettes** - In the mid 2000s, there were
  constantly new genres of indie that were going to be the next big thing, but
  produced a few big records before fading away. "Pre-Beatles pop-music" was
  such an animal, and the 60s girl groups were an obvious place find
  inspiration. In retrospect this does seem like the kind of gimmick that
  wouldn't last long, but what a glorious debut record. They sing in an
  untrained but pure tone that sounds great together. The pop songwriting is
  great, especially on the classic "Pull Shapes". [*Memory*: Yet another band
  that I discovered on HDNet London Live. It was such a surprise to see such an
  out there concept get any attention at all. I remember having Greg at City
  Lights order me a copy of their first US EP, and him asking me "so is this
  like a 60s girl group or something?" Kinda, but not exactly in a way that
  really, really worked for a short time.]

- *Operation: Mindcrime II* by **Queensryche** - What a huge surprise. A sequel
  to one of my favorite albums of all time arrived, and it was far better than I
  could have imagined. A remarkable return to the classic sound of this band, we
  now know it mostly a Geoff Tate solo album. It would have been impossible to
  achieve the same high level of the original, but this is about 75% the
  quality, which is still very, very good. More than anything it takes the story
  to a new place, that somehow makes the first record more interesting from a
  narrative perspective. [*Memory*: I hadn't thought much about these guys in
  years when I heard that this was coming out. Thanks to this record I would
  re-engage with their back-catalog and they would become one of my all-time
  favorites.]

- *Classics* by **Ratatat** - Instrumental rock that is very much not post-rock,
  this whimsical record is more like the modern **Ventures**. One of those bands
  where every album is very similar, and I only end up caring about their very
  best effort. [*Memory*: In 2007, I went on a bus tour of the Irish
  countryside north of Dublin. I remember a rich doctor was there with his wife
  and adult son who was wearing a Ratatat shirt. Why do I remember this, I don't
  know. I've got nothing else for here.]

- *Hello Everything* by **Squarepusher** - His records had been expanding to
  include more and more elements, and the title of this one seems to recognize a
  peak had been reached. After this he would bite off a bit more than he could
  chew, but the eclecticism works out well here. The jazz influenced electronica
  of "Planetarium" is a particular favorite, and probably the high point for
  this guy. [*Memory*: I found out about this artist on XM Beyond Jazz, where I
  heard "Modern Jazz Guitar". The early XM was a great platform, and while I am
  still a happy customer of the modern SiriusXM, I miss those old stations with
  their edge case genres, and massive, handcrafted playlists.]

- *A Lesson in Crime* by **Tokyo Police Club** - Sometimes a band's first work
  is their best, and in this case it is a 17 minute long EP. The rawness and
  rough edges are a positive here, and it is almost like they ruined themselves
  by started to understand what they were doing. This is pure garage, the sounds
  of kids who don't completely know how to make rock music, but do so pretty
  effectively anyway. The songs are strange and wonderful, particularly the
  charmingly amateurish science fiction of "Citizens of Tomorrow". They would
  never come close to this again. This is my favorite EP of all time. [*Memory*:
  I saw the band play an opening set as "the next big thing" in a packed to the
  gills basement club in Temple Bar Dublin. They played the EP in sequence and
  nothing more. They pulled a girl up from the crowd to sing the one line of
  female vocals from "Nature of the Experiment". A buzz band at their peak, and
  I was glad to be there.]

2007
----

I had a sense that when I got to this year, I would have a bit to say in the
introduction text, but didn't anticipate all the topics that would come to mind.
This was a pivotal year for the music industry, and for me as a listener. These
two things are not coincidental. The MP3 had almost a decade to destroy the model
for pop music that had existed since the late 1960s, and at least initially,
what was left in the ashes was wonderful. By 2007, portable media had made the
MP3 a practical means for music consumption in almost all contexts. In
mainstream music, the single was now again king, but album based rock music was
somehow stronger than ever. Digital distribution had raised awareness of indie
acts that in previous decades would have mostly toiled in obscurity and at best
might have been the favorites of music nerds, and then only retrospectively
be discovered by listeners at large. In this era of music blogs, the obscure could
rapidly become ubiquitous, and attention was getting drawn to increasingly
diverse models of what rock music could be.

The way I was consuming music was changing rapidly, but I clung to the old ways
out of nostalgic stubbornness. Like most people my age I had accumulated a
significant and very not-legit collection of MP3s. Around this time in my life,
I started to assemble a legit recreation and expansion of these illicit files. I
was using an expanded pallette of (legal) means to acquire and curate a rapidly
growing collection. This was the golden age of the subscription/buffet pricing
scheme at eMusic, who for a nominal fee (15-20 dollars a month) could provide a
path to 10 or more indie label releases in digital format. At the time, I had
started to buy my first digital albums from Amazon, but digital was eclipsed by
CDs which were still the main way music was fining its way into my collection. I
would visit City Lights records every Tuesday during my lunch break and leave
with a clutch of the latest releases and likely a bunch of catalog titles I had
special ordered. These were the first crys of "the CD is dead" but I wasn't
listening. I kept detailed records of every release that made it into my
collection regardless of format and I know that the first album I bought
(*Hissing Fauna, Are you the Destroyer?* by **Of Montreal**) was the 900th item
cataloged. A full 372 albums later, the 1272nd record (*Weirdo Rippers* by **No
Age**) would be logged, surely the most music I have ever acquired in a single
calendar year.

Most of the music I was listening to was still from years gone by, but I was
listening to more new music than I had ever done before. I have an interesting
artifact from this time, the first comprehensive attempt I ever made at a best
of the year list as a full grown adult. It isn't the final version (unfortunately
lost to time) but an in progress version that I sent to myself via E-mail. I
remember working on this list during my lunch breaks at work during the last
months of the year, and I was sending it home to complete there over the holiday
break. At this point, I owned and could assess 79 different releases! I know
what I considered to be my top 25 records at that time, and 20 of those still
make my modern list. This is a much higher ratio than what would survive from my
2009 favorites (see below), and I think this is a product of my ability to still
listen with a kind of focus that the copious consumption facilitated by digital
streaming would soon destroy.

One of the five records that appeared on that original list of favorites that
doesn't appear on my modern list feels like a case study in everything mentioned
above. *In Rainbows* by **Radiohead** was the first "pay what you want", DRM
free, digital release by a major, internationally famous rock band. Admittedly,
they were a famous rock band that didn't seem very interested in being famous.
At the time I have no doubt that I included it on my list because I thought that
it was an important release, and 15 years later, I am convinced that it is one
of the most important releases there has ever been. That said, it isn't a great
album. Interestingly, as a band that became famous for working in the long form,
it was mostly a miss as a long player. There are some killer singles on there
though, and "Reckoner" is probably my favorite song of all-time from them, and
one of the most beautiful rock songs ever made. It is hard to view this album
separate from the context in which it was released, and I can't of a better way
to summarize where pop music was in 2007 and my relationship with it.

- *Pocket Symphony* by **Air** - A colder more somber record from these guys
  that fits in very well with their other work. It is happy to sit in the
  background in a way their other records do not. That icy, sterile album cover
  is a perfect summary. [*Memory*: I remember Greg from City Lights Records
  telling me he liked to put this on as he was starting his day in the store.
  That sounds just right to me.]

- *American Doll Posse* by **Tori Amos** - This was the beginning of a Tori
  revival for me, and the start of a revival for the artist. I think playing a
  few "alternate roles" for the concept of this record was freeing, and we got
  something considerably more interesting than what had come immediately before.
  Every album since this one has been a winner. So many different styles on this
  record from the mid-tempo singer-songwriter fare of "Bouncing Off of Clouds"
  to the rocking "Teenage Hustling" to the classic devastating story song
  balladry of "Roosterspur Bridge". [*Memory*: I saw Tori for the first time on
  this tour, when it came to Pittsburgh. It was a halloween show and the crowd
  really took the costume thing very seriously.]

- *New Magnetic Wonder* by **The Apples in Stereo** - I was very into Elephant 6
  at the time and was very interested that one of the original bands was still
  making new music. This was the first of two records in a a very **ELO** style,
  with some weird atonal experiments thrown in. Some stunning pop music, that
  makes me sad that Robert Schnieder has largely retired from performing.
  [*Memory*: At the time I didn't like the shift to **Jeff Lynne** territory,
  but wow do I prefer it to the garage psych of their early records now.]

- *Or Give Me Death* by **Aqueduct** - Even more than the first record, this
  album sounds a bit like what would happen if **Modest Mouse** went full blown
  pop. Some really interesting, intricate songs. I really wish more folks had
  found these guys so they could have made more music. [*Memory*: I saw them as
  an opening act at Water Street, a few years after this record came out. I
  think I was the only one who was familiar with their stuff. Great show.]

- *Neon Bible* by **Arcade Fire** - Until the awful **Everything Now** was
  released, this was my least favorite of their albums. Unlike that mess, I
  still really like this one. It was never going to live up to the incredible
  debut, but there is a lot here to like. I especially enjoy the church organ
  and pomp of "Intervention" and "My Body is a Cage". [*Memory*: I waited a
  really long time to buy this one on vinyl. I'm not sure why, as this is a
  brilliant record that sounds great on the analog format.]

- *Mirrored* by **Battles** - A really cool, percussion forward post-rock album.
  Not quite math rock, but still lots of interesting rhythms. They would never
  make something this interesting again. [*Memory*: This kind of defines the
  line for an album I like, but don't need to own on vinyl. I've considered it
  many times, but really digital is good enough for this. Why, I'm not exactly
  sure.]

- *Flying Club Cup* by **Beirut** - One of those bands, where I like much of
  their music, but love only a few things. This is by far my favorite of their
  records. It is a much stronger statement with solid songwriting throughout. "A
  Sunday Smile" has those nostalgic, highly melodic, feel good vibes that is
  their best sound. [*Memory*: I saw Owen Pallet join them on some of these
  tunes at Pitchfork 2009, and it is the moment you see in the banner above.]

- *..are the Dark Horse* by **The Besnard Lakes** - A really nice low-fi, psych
  record with some cool little **Beach Boys** elements. They would milk this
  formula to good effect for a few more records, but this will always be my
  favorite. "For Agent 13" is my favorite use of shortwave numbers stations in a
  song. [*Memory*: When I started buying vinyl records, this was one of the
  first recent releases I picked up. It was also one of the first records that
  made me realize the shortcomings of vinyl production, when it arrived covered
  in scuffs.]

- *Armchair Apocrypha * by **Andrew Bird** - I know many people consider this
  the inferior follow-up, but I prefer it to anything else in his catalog. I
  think it focusses more on straight ahead indie rock in a way that serves the
  purpose well. The slick use of the looper and strings is still there, but the
  songs are sharper and catchier. That said, this isn't something I am
  revisiting often today. [*Memory*: I saw him on this tour at the State Theater
  in State College, PA. I really enjoyed the show. Only a few years later I saw
  him in Rochester and it was awful. Had the performance changed, or had I?]

- *23* by **Blonde Redhead** - A really nice midpoint between dream-pop and
  straight ahead indie rock. I didn't realize it at the time since I was
  discovering them well into their career, but this is the sound of an "old
  indie" band updating their sound to fit right in with the new scene of the
  moment. [*Memory*: I have to admit, I bought this as much for the striking
  cover as for the solid reviews. Surely one of the last times I picked a record
  that way?]

- *Andorra* by **Caribou** - It doesn't seem like it today, because this kind of
  thing is everywhere now, but this kind of psychedelic, electronic thing was
  very innovative at the time. He would have two great records after this, but
  this was the peak. A great mix of pop and experimentation. [*Memory*: I'm a
  bit ashamed to admit that back in these days I was getting almost anything
  Pitchfork gave BNM to that sounded half wise interesting. The indie stuff was
  all on Emusic, and an album was about 2-3 bucks there. It was worth it to even
  hate listen the thing. This one really worked out.]

- *Friend Opportunity* by **Deerhoof** - My first record of theirs, and still my
  favorite. The perfect mix of the punk aggression and the pop cuteness. The
  definitive early 2000s indie band at their peak. Such complex, unusual music
  that manages to be unbelievably re-listenable. I'll never get sick of this
  record. [*Memory*: This was an amazing time for musical discovery. The tools
  at my disposal to hear new things and rise of indie created a unique situation
  I will never see again. Every couple weeks I was discovering a new favorite
  band like this that already had a half a dozen or so great albums.]

- *Copia* by **Eluvium** - It is hard to make ambient music that really stands
  out. This is gorgeous, and wholely unique. There isn't anything else out there
  with this same kind of warm but vacant vibe. The title of the track "Indoor
  Swimming at the Space Station" really captures the scene well. [*Memory*: I
  was really into the ambient works by Eno at the time and when I saw a modern
  ambient record getting good press, I had to check it out.]

- *Widow City* by **The Fiery Furnaces** - A number of indie pop acts had been
  becoming increasingly weird over the last decade or so, and these guys started
  out the weirdest of them all. This is a lot to digest. The funky keyboards,
  the Zeppelin-esque hard rock guitar, Emily Freidberger's off-kilter delivery
  of her brothers weird poetry, all framed by mostly jaunty piano based pop
  songs. Peak weird suited these guys best of all. [*Memory*: At the time, they
  had been so productive it was easy to assume this would go on indefinitely.
  Little did we know we would get only one more (fairly conservative) effort,
  and the sibling band would go on permanent hiatus.]

- *The Good, The Bad, and the Queen* by **The Good, The Bad, and the Queen** -
  The work of a unusual supergroup that ends up sounding more like the somber,
  non-fiction continuation of its most famous member's former band (Blur). A
  brilliant meditation on the role of England in the 21st century. For almost 10
  years, this was the most valuable record in my collection, and it deserved to
  be so. It is a cult classic of the highest order, and one of my very
  favorites. [*Memory*: In 2007 I took two trips to the UK for business. Both
  times I was able to get up to London to do some tourist stuff. This album
  became the soundtrack to the first trip and I streamed it repeatedly on my
  trusty old iPod nano. On the second trip I saw a special performance of the
  record in the moat of the Tower of London. What a memory I will cherish
  forever!]

- *White Chalk* by **PJ Harvey** - [**2007 FAVORITE**] What a left turn for
  Polly Jean. The guitar is almost gone. The muscular vocals are no more,
  replaced with her "church voice". The aesthetic of this album is remarkable.
  Barely proficient enough to make a piano based record, she finds incredible
  songs in the simple arrangements. The creepy victorian attire she matched to
  this music really completed the scene. Already an all-time great, this is
  where it went to the next level. [*Memory*: I was already going to City Lights
  every Tuesday to pick up the latest releases, but I particularly remember
  rushing out as soon as the store opened that September to pick this one up.]

- *Cross* by **Justice** - While **Daft Punk** generally get all the attention
  these guys made the foremost masterpiece of French Electronic music right
  here. Everything is perfect, from the bombast of "Genesis", through the pure
  joy of "D.A.N.C.E." to the wonderful crassness of **Uffie's** rap on "The
  Party". This might be the best electronic dance music ever made. [*Memory*: I
  used to like to play this during my runs at the time. I remember playing it
  over the stereo system in the work gym one time and being really embarrassed
  when **Uffie** started in on her rap, lol.]

- *Sound of Silver* by **LCD Soundsystem** - It can be hard to remember that
  before EDM ruined things, electronic music was was of the most interesting and
  fertile grounds for new musical ideas. They aren't really doing anything new
  here, but the combination of Krautrock grooves, disco beats, and New Wave
  vocals was the perfect pallette for some great songs. "Someone Great" is a top
  10 all-time track. [*Memory*: I was already sold on these guys from their
  early singles and was right on this album when it was released. I remember
  Greg at City lights being very lukewarm. I remember telling one of the trendy
  interns at work about it, and how meh they were. It eventually became regarded
  as an all time classic. I felt very ahead of the curve.]

- *Night Falls over Kortedala* by **Jens Lekman** - This is a weird case. A
  classic album, that the artist decided to replace with a completely new
  version. I think I still like the original more, since it has a wonderful
  quaintness that isn't quite as strong on the new version. It is a guy trying
  to make the symphonic **Scott Walker** records in his bedroom. The kind of
  pure pop singing that only Scandinavians are allowed to do these days.
  [*Memory*: This was the first year that I reviewed the top albums lists by the
  major sites. This one was very high on the Pitchfork list and I gave it a
  shot.]

- *Memory Almost Full* by **Paul McCarney** - Paul clearly was becoming aware of
  the peaking indie rock scene, and it shows. One of his strongest later year
  efforts, especially the power pop of "Only Mamma Knows" and the eccentric
  vocoder and harpsichord experimental pop of "Feet in the Clouds". [*Memory*:
  I remember listening to this on my Sansa as I waited for my plane from
  Heathrow to Dublin, drinking a Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout right at the gate.]

- *Obligatory Villagers* by **Nellie McKay** - It is weird that her best album
  is almost impossible to hear these days, and I'm glad to have the physical CD
  (I assume there are rights issues). The perfect combination of comical
  commentary and top notch songwriting. This time with an amazing collection of
  jazz musicians to give everything a dramatic cabaret feel. [*Memory*: Soon
  after this album, she did a video with NPR music that documented her
  songwriting process, which was quite remarkable.]

- *Friend and Foe* by **Menomena** - The first shot fired in the "floor tom
  band" scene. This highly percussive brand of melodic indie rock was super
  novel at time, but would be cliche less than a year later. Still a solid
  record, but it is hard to hear it the same way after all the soundalikes. The
  sax does add a little something extra that makes this hold up a bit better
  than the rest. [*Memory*: These guys hold the unique distinction of being a
  band I have seen live, but do not really remember having seen. I saw them in
  Philly in 2010, and remember it as being a good show, but nothing else really.
  At least I have the shirt to prove I was there.]

- *Challengers* by **The New Pornographers** - An outstanding record that both
  shows what a great pop band they are together, but the strengths that the
  three primary songwriters have as individuals. Also some great vocals from new
  member Kathryn Calder, especially "Adventures in Solitude". "My Rights Versus
  Yours" is one of the greatest opening tracks ever. The way it slowly builds to
  introduce the sounds of the record is first rate album sequencing. [*Memory*:
  At first I wasn't so sure about the mellower mood of this record, but I now
  appreciate this as one of their finest efforts.]

- *Boxer* by **The National** - The pivot album between the more punk influenced
  sounds of the first few records, and the mid-tempo alt-rock that would come.
  First rate musicianship throughout, and Matt Berninger's voice is as rich and
  textured as it would ever be. "Mistaken for Strangers" is the finest product
  of their early phase. [*Memory*: I was so resistant to these guys, and refused
  to engage with this record when it was new. All of a sudden when I hit my 30s,
  I liked few bands more.]

- *Hissing Fauna, You Are the Destroyer* by **Of Montreal** - The album where
  his bedroom psych pop went dance. It wasn't as big of a tweak as it sounded at
  the time, but it was apparently the move that made the world appreciate the
  talent that had always been there. [*Memory*: I remember playing this CD in my
  office after a visit to City Lights Records on new music Tuesday. The uptempo
  dance groove was a bit shocking to me as a long time fan, but I was on board
  for the new sounds from the start. I was shocked that the general public was
  too. It was a unique time.]

- *The Stage Names* by **Okkervil River** - This was a straightforward indie
  rock pallette cleanser in one of the most experimental eras. The definition of
  NPR music, it is quaint but not bland, and often quite pretty. "Savannah
  Smiles" is a particular highlight. [*Memory*: I saw these guys in Rochester on
  the next album cycle. It was clear from the setlist that they recognized this
  as their best work.]

- *Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga* by **Spoon** - Indie rock was peaking and new buzz bands were
  emerging every week. Some of the American indie acts that had been at it since
  the late 90s were raising to prominence in a whole new way. This was the
  record where Austin's biggest secret used their heightened influence to make a
  very big, Motown tinged record. It was their highest point. [*Memory*: There
  are two times in my life I had to pull over my car because I heard a new song
  that was too good for me to concentrate. "You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb" was one of
  them.]
  
- *Marry Me* by **St. Vincent** - Far smaller, but no less complex, the contrast
  is stunning with where the artist is now. I miss the sound of this record (and
  the one that came later). Somehow she has gotten way noisier and flashier, yet
  way more boring. These ornate, but subtle home recordings are some of the
  finest songs in indie-pop history. I try to not be one of those people who
  complain about artists selling out for mainstream fame, but I can't see
  anything else here. [*Memory*: I downloaded this record from eMusic based
  purely on their review. I got so much great music off of that site.]

- *In Our Bedroom After the War* by **Stars** - I know the record before this is
  supposed to be the classic (and it is a perfectly fine indie pop record) but
  this will always be my favorite. Such sweet little songs with strong
  melodies and warm vocals. Every now and then they show glimpses of something
  more than pop, like the jazz influenced "My Favorite Book". [*Memory*: One of
  those records I listened to on repeat on my Sansa MP3 player during lunchtime
  walks at work around the East College Ave area.]

- *Random Spirit Lover* by **Sunset Rubdown** - A wonderfully strange record.
  Low budget indie-prog made by an artist who had won fame making straight ahead
  indie rock with his other band **Wolf Parade**. I assume that connection was
  the only reason the general music press even cared about this, but I'm glad it
  was brought to my attention. You get the impression that the musicians being
  stretched way beyond their ability, but what they produced ended up amazing
  anyway. "Stallion" is so over the top and outrageously good. [*Memory*: When I
  started buying Vinyl LPs, this was one of the first things I sought out. This
  is meant for physical media.]

- *All Hour Cymbals* by **Yeasayer** - **Menomena** were first, but this was the
  record that broke the sound. One of those discs that would spawn a million
  imitators, this kind of percussive, dance-able indie-pop would be pervasive
  over the next half decade. While this band would soon move on to other
  things, they leave behind one of the finest and most interesting entries in
  the sub-genre. [*Memory*: I distinctly remember listening to this for the
  first time waiting for an early AM flight at the State College, PA airport.]

2008
----

When I look at my favorites I am struck by two things. First, almost the entire
list is comprised of fairly new (at the time) indie acts, with only two "legacy"
artists in **Portishead** and **Steven Wilson** (who was himself a newly minted
solo artist after the end of **Porcupine Tree**). The second thing I notice is
how almost all of these were discovered as they came out and represent what I
was actually listening to in 2008. Only the **Metronomy** and **William
Brittelle** records were retrospective discoveries, and only by a year or two
each. It almost seems like this is the most aligned I would be with what was hot
and "now". This year also has the distinction of being the year that I bought a
turntable and started buying vinyl records (in November). It was here that I
started the practice of buying my favorites on vinyl. Without streaming, new
discoveries were often still made on CD, so I own no less than 11 of the albums
below on both vinyl and CD. If it wasn't on eMusic, I was often getting new
music on the small discs and making the upgrade when something became a
favorite.

- *Devotion* by **Beach House** - The second (and final) record in their
  original sound before moving to far bigger and more popular sonic territory. I
  do prefer what they would become, but there is a lot to love on these much
  smaller, and more acoustic early songs. They would keep going upwards from
  here, but they were always great. [*Memory*: I saw them on this album cycle
  playing a twin headline show with **The Walkmen** at the TLA in Philadelphia.
  I had a nice chat with Vicky Legrand at the merch booth and shared the memory
  of their issues at their first London show in 2007. She smiled and almost
  yelled: "You saw the worst show ever!" I bought of copy the "Used to Be"
  single as a 45 and when I got home from the 3 hour drive, I listened to the
  sound of what was to come.]

- *William Brittelle* by **Mohair Timewarp** - My point of entry would be his
  concept 2010 concept album, but I would circle back to this weird art rock
  record not long after. A very strange album with extremely strange lyrics. I
  really wish New Amsterdam was releasing music like this. [*Memory*: This
  might end up being the last CD I ever buy. I realized it was one of the few
  albums I didn't own in any format and it wasn't streaming. So I bought a CD
  copy in early 2022.]

- *Half Hours with the Lower Creatures* by **Rachel Taylor Brown** - I'm fairly
  certain 99% of the folks who know about this artist, were introduced via the
  appearance of "Stagg Field" on NPR's "All Songs Considered". I'm not a huge
  fan of the show, but I really have to credit those guys for shining a light on
  some very non-commercial music by an obscure artist who would otherwise get no
  attention. A terrific art rock album. [*Memory*: After hearing this amazing
  record and the follow up in 2009 that I liked even more, I ordered her entire
  back catalog from CD Baby. The rest wasn't that great.]

- *In Ghost Colours* by **Cut Copy** - There were a bunch of bands that were
  making music that referenced an imaginary version of the 80s that never really
  existed, and then there were these guys. This is a wonderful modernization of
  **New Order** or **OMD** for the home recording era. [*Memory*: I totally held
  a vinyl copy of this in my hand at the Pitchfork music festival in 2009. I
  didn't realize how few of them they made, and that it would never get a
  re-issue. This kind of thing would go out of style, and I assume it will never
  be repressed.]

- *Missiles* by **The Dears** - Another great Canadian husband/wife band (why
  are there so many of these?). If **The Arcade Fire** are too subtle for you,
  you can count on these guys. Super over the top, dramatic rock that manages to
  be both kinda stupid and very beautiful. [*Memory*: Around this time I was
  listening to the XM Canadian indie channel called "The Verge" where I
  discovered this band and many other favorites.]

- *Offend Maggie* by **Deerhoof** - Simultaneously one of the heavier and
  quieter albums by one of the most unique acts to come out of millennial indie.
  [*Memory*: I regretted buying this on vinyl at the time, which feels odd to me
  now. It also happens to be one of the more valuable albums I own now.]

- *Microcastle* by **Deerhunter** - This is where the formula came together. All
  the great psychedelic atmospherics were still there, but now we had moments of
  supreme pop songwriting spread throughout. [*Memory*: I was always very
  skeptical of Pitchfork, but man they were right to champion this amazing
  record.]

- *In Ear Park* by **Department of Eagles** - One of those records I like way
  more than almost everyone else. I still like this slightly more than any of
  the albums by Dan Rosen's main band, **Grizzly Bear**. I've always been a
  sucker for this kind of fuzzy, layered production, and the spare piano based
  arrangements really work for this kind of music. [*Memory*: For some reason
  this became a favorite album to listen to while I ran around this time.
  Totally inappropriate to task, this was the soundtrack to many laps around the
  Penn State IM building track.]

- *The Barbarians Move In* by **Duels** - A massive change-up after the UK Indie
  pop of the first record. A moody post-punk record, with moments of orchestral
  rock pomp. The title song is a striking, dirge-like record that makes me
  wonder what happened to these guys between releases [*Memory*: I didn't
  realize until the end of the year that this had come out. There were a few
  reviews on Amazon where folks were calling this a lost classic. They were right.] 

- *4* by **Dungen** - A return to the softer, more melodic side of things.
  Doesn't feature the flute like what came before and after, but still gorgeous
  stuff. [*Melody*: This was around the time the English language imitators
  **Tame Impala** appeared. It really bummed me out that this album was
  overshadowed by second class copycats.]

- *The Seldom Seen Kid* by **Elbow** - The biggest band to come out of 2000s UK
  Indie. They came up with a sound that combined the best points of **Blur**
  style Britpop and classic **Peter Gabriel** style Art Rock. This was the album
  after which they became too big to be Indie any longer. [*Memory*: When this
  album first was getting press, I dismissed it as the next **Coldplay** but I'm
  glad they proved me wrong.]

- *Sleep Well* by **Electric President** - This was the last record that I really
  enjoyed from the minimalist electro-indie pop that was big in the first decade
  of the millennium. Some really great shoegazey post-rocky guitar in this one
  that added a new texture to their sound. A very mellow record with a calm vibe
  that I really enjoy. [*Memory*: This reminds me of the walks that I would take
  during lunch break from work, listening to my latest music acquisitions on my
  old school Sansa 200 MP3 player. This was a nice calm record to put on in the
  middle of stressful day at a startup company.]

- *The Midnight Organ Fight* by **Frightened Rabbit** - The most Scottish of the
  Scottish bands. Such a wonderful folk-punk band with enough UK Indie bombast
  to make a big sound without going over the top. They would never match this
  again, but most bands never make one almost this amazing. [*Memory*: I liked
  this record the first time I heard it, but I didn't really connect with it
  until a trip to LA in late 2008. This was a difficult trip for me, as I
  realized I was growing apart from the group of friends I was traveling with. I
  took the MetroLink train into the city solo to have a look around, and this
  was the soundtrack to my visit.]

- *Into Your Lungs...* by **Hey Rosetta!** - This year was probably the peak of
  Canadian Indie and this was one of the most representative records of the
  scene. So big (but unpretentious), so elegantly produced (but still quaintly
  charming), a remarkable record. Americans can't make music this kind of music
  without sounding like cheeseballs. [*Memory*: This was another record that got
  a ton of play on XM The Verge. Canadian Indie was where it was at in 2008.]

- *Made in the Dark* by **Hot Chip** - The start of a more "serious" turn from
  these guys. This still is slightly goofy dance-pop, but the humor was no
  longer the focus. Still charmingly self-recorded, but the more straight ahead
  themes makes for a more long lasting impact. [*Memory*: I forever get this
  mixed up with the record that would come next (they are both great!) I even
  included this record in the image for both years.]

- *Feed the Animals* by **Girl Talk** - One of the last great outcomes of pop
  music's post modern era. It was also one of the most notable "pay what you
  want" downloads in the post-MP3 era. His best attempt at merging the classic
  rock and hip-hop eras. [*Memory*: Another running playlist regular for me.
  Hard to hear this without thinking about turning laps at Tudek Park in State
  College, PA.]

- *Couples* by **The Long Blondes** - One of the most unjustifiably ignored
  follow up records out there. Just as good as their much loved debut, this
  record probably mostly suffered from a lack of promotion and tour support. My
  favorite band from the pop side of the post punk revival, this band blows away
  **The Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs** in my opinion. It is very sad this would be the end.
  [*Memory*: I was amazed to buy an unopened back-stock original pressing of
  this in 2021, 13 years after release (on Amazon of all places!).]

- *Saturdays = Youth* by **M83** - Looking back, it almost seems like this
  record is the genesis of the entire "imagined 80s" aesthetic that would
  predominate a wide swath of the indie over the next 3-4 years. The chillwave,
  the vaporwave, the other acts that seemed to be imitating a kind of 80s pop
  music that never actually quite existed. Look at that cover, and its
  characters from not quite a John Hughes film. It isn't actually that different
  from what this band had done in the record that preceded it, but it just found
  a focus that anticipated what was to come. [*Memory*: It is hard to think of
  this record without thinking of Hipster Runoff. Our boy Carles also understood
  how important this sound would be to the future direction of indie.]

- *Rabbit Habits* by **Man Man** - This album feels like a straight up
  modernization of the **Captain Beefheart** formula. It is a complete anomaly
  in the indie scene of the day that works really well. [*Memory*: This is the
  last show I would ever see at the State Theater in State College, PA. A great
  venue that would bring a kind of indie show to the town for a short window in
  the last years of the aughts. They didn't have a liquor license at the time,
  but had a great coffee shop. I was so hyped up on caffeine for the show, and
  that was the right state for this music. The headliner was **Cursive**, who
  were awful, and I left after one song.]

- *Nights Out* by **Metronomy** - Unlike most people, I prefer the more poppy
  records to come, but I like this as well. Much like **Hot Chip**, this band
  knows exactly where to find the line between joke band and serious music.
  [*Memory*: I was first attracted to this album by the amazing cover with the
  painting of the guy proudly in front of the first generation Honda Insight.]

- *Oracular Spectacular* by **MGMT** - No band or album exemplifies the
  "mainstreaming of indie" more than what we have here. It deserved to be the
  thing that broke indie to the general public. Fun but smart electronic pop
  music, the kind of thing that appeals to teenagers and music collecting forty
  year olds in equal measure. This is the least weird record this group is
  likely to ever make, and likely the beginning and the end of any wide cultural
  significance. [*Memory*: These guys have always been a major label act, but it
  was the indie music fans who discovered them first. It was shocking to see a
  band like this get such massive attention, but in retrospect the whole thing
  felt calculated by Columbia. The birth of Mindie Rock.]

- *A Thousand Shark's Teeth* by **My Brightest Diamond** - A transitionary
  record between the guitar centered songs she started with, and the very fancy
  chamber pop that was coming next. One of the greatest voices in indie, who
  often doesn't get enough credit for the range and quality of her songwriting.
  I do miss the occasional heaviness she worked into the first two records.
  [*Memory*: The first time I saw Shara live was at Bugjar in 2011, when she was
  still in the guitar focussed configuration of this album cycle. It was quietist
  I have ever seen an audience be while an artist performed at that venue.]

- *Skeletal Lamping* by **Of Montreal** - My opinions of this record have
  evolved significantly over time: starting at disappointing mess, to flawed but
  partially listenable, and today as possibly the best record by one of my
  favorite acts from these days. This collection of micro-songs really needs to
  be listened to all at once. It is also best not to spend too much time
  thinking about the often cringeworthy lyrics, and instead focus on how
  interesting it all sounds. [*Memory*: When this came out, I really thought
  that fame had gone to Kevin Barnes head, and ruined him. It turns out fame did
  go to his head, and created something wonderfully over the top.]

- *Third* by **Portishead** - [**2008 Favorite**] - It seems like this is going
  to be the last album by this legendary band, and I'm happy with this being
  their final and most important statement. There is no other album like this,
  and it arrived as wholely unique in music history. This haunting,
  uncomfortably minimalist electronic music only makes sense when listened to in
  a dark room. The way they deconstruct their own signature sound on "Machine
  Gun" is one of the most unique things a band has ever done. A top 5 favorite
  of mine forever. [*Memory*: This album made it painfully clear to me how bad
  the state of vinyl production was at the time. I bought three copies of it,
  until I was able to assemble a single reasonable copy from discs extracted
  from two different instances of the album.]

- *Rook* by **Shearwater** - Such a beautiful voice, and so much instrumental
  talent in this band. That said, this is the only one of their records that
  doesn't bore me to tears. The significant use of the classic emo quiet/loud
  dynamic is what does it for me I guess. [*Memory*: This was the vinyl album
  that made me realize how good things could be when you got a good pressing.
  For some reason, I was able to get this for like 5 bucks on Overstock.com. It
  was an impulse buy that inspired me to buy my first proper Turntable. I can
  remember clearly hearing the crisp, surface noise free sounds in my tiny
  upstairs room in the Woodycest apartment I shared at the time. I had the
  record on the Technics SL-1200 I still use, and probably will use for the rest
  of my life.]

- *At War With Walls & Mazes* by **Son Lux** - One of those acts that owes their
  career and fame to NPR music. This nerdy electo-hip hop is the kind of thing
  that is ready made for Public Radio. I prefer the proggy sounds that would
  come later with the full band incarnation, but this early recording still has
  much of the sounds that would be perfected in later work. [*Memory*: This
  record holds the distinction of being the first I owned and discovered
  exclusively on the vinyl format.]

- *Soft Airplane* by **Chad Vangaalen** - The weirdest folk rock record I have
  ever heard, and one of the best. The lyrics and music are both completely off
  the wall. I don't feel that he has ever reached these heights again as an
  artist, and it seems like his best effort went into his production of other
  artists from here on out. [*Memory*: Hearing the classic Casio drum machine
  sounds on "TMNT Mask" really took me back to the old SK-1 days.]

- *You & Me* by **The Walkmen** - By far my favorite band to come out of the
  Post Punk revival, they would rapidly transcend that genre and make amazing
  records like this. I love the warm textured sounds, and the over the top
  belting. I saw these guys twice on this tour. If I could go back in time
  to see any band, I would see the Walkmen at this point in their history.
  [*Memory*: I remember sitting in my tiny Rochester apartment as December 2009
  became January 2010 listening to the song "In the New Year". I hatched a plan
  to make a list of my favorite records from the closing decade. I never did
  that properly, but it started the larger project this site represents.]

- *Women* by **Women** - Angular, chaotic post-punk. They almost seem like the
  only band to follow on from **Wire's** late 70s trilogy. They even through in
  a slick pop song in "Black Rice". Stellar stuff, I wish they were able to make
  more than the two albums they left us. [*Memory*: This album was a complete
  impulse buy that I threw in on a vinyl order from the Simply Canadian website.
  I was intimidated by it at first, but the format made me stick with it, and
  I'm glad I did, wow!]

- *Insurgentes* by **Steven Wilson** - Looking back now, his first solo record
  was the biggest deviation from the **Porcupine Tree** sound. It is hard to put
  a finger on exactly what is different, but this is clearly more a product of a
  single person working alone. I think his music has been well served by the
  changes, and alone his music has been more consistent than his band ever was.
  "Significant Other" with its layered ethereal vocals and creepy toy piano is
  probably still my favorite thing from his solo era. [*Memory*: I remember at
  the time reflecting on how this was the last vestiges of my musical past, with
  indie my clear future.]

2009
----

I have been looking forward to this year. That is because in 2009 I spent
a lot of time documenting my favorites of the year, and therefore have a very
detailed understanding of my top records at the time of release. I even went so
far as to make a three disc compilation of my top tracks and distribute to my
friends. It was a throwback to my 1999 compilation (more on that later) and a
way to cap off what was a landmark year for my relationship with contemporary
pop music. That said, looking at the notes I distributed with the mix CDs, I
have to cringe a bit.

  :alt: notes to my 2009 mix CDs

I sound so young for a 29 year old, but I think my connection to pop music at
the time was making me feel young and I wanted to revel in it a bit. Admittedly,
I would never feel this connected to pop music again. Despite these somewhat
silly notes, I would actually get quite a few positive comments about the mix,
and even received three mixes in response! None of them were as carefully
curated and supplemented with footnotes, but it was nice to hear what other
folks were into at the time. I feel like I could spend a remarkable amount of
time analyzing how I feel now compared to what my impressions were at the time,
but for now I am going to keep this to a simple comparison of my top albums then
and now. Here are the albums that appear in my 2009 top 20 that I no longer
consider to be among my favorites:

- *Mythomania* by **Cryptacise** - (#7) I was really feeling high on this band after
  seeing them at Noise Pop 2009, but my interest really faded as I got away from
  that show. In general that early 60s pop revival stuff hasn't aged great for
  me.
  
- *A Brief History of Love* by **The Big Pink** - (#8) Two killer singles "Dominos"
  and especially "Velvet" made me greatly overate this at the time.

- *Eyes & Eyes & Eyes Ago* by **Nesey Gallons** - (#9) I really was into
  Elephant 6 at the time, and wanted to like the latest artists in the
  collective, even if they weren't up to spec.

- *Up From Below* by **Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros** - (#12) I
  didn't like their "dirt hipster" image when I saw them live, mostly because of
  my bad experiences with this demographic as as South Wedge resident. Listening
  to this record again with fresh ears, I probably need to give it another
  chance.
  
- *Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix* by **Phoenix** - (#17) I used to love these guys,
  but listening now I can't understand why. Such generic dance indie.

- *Embryonic* by **The Flaming Lips** - (#18) Totally fine, like most of their
  records. Doesn't feel as interesting after others have done this kind of thing
  much better.

- *The Good Feeling Music of Dent May & His Magnificent Ukulele* by **Dent May**
  - (#20) I was responding to the amazing pop songcraft here, despite the
  annoying ukulele packaging. With his later work, this is inessential. Wish he
  had made a new version of the brilliant "College Town Boy" though.

As for my numbers 21-40, that feels like me stretching to make a list, though I
will comment on a couple that moved up to my favorites when they show up in my
current list.

This was the year I attended my first two music festivals, where I discovered
a ton of music. Also, in the fall I moved to Rochester, NY and had access to
much more live music and four fantastic record stores. It was at one of these,
Lakeshore Record Exchange, that I would buy many of the last CDs in my
collection. This is the last year that CDs will appear in significant number in
my photo of favorites. This was the most involved photo in this whole project to
create. I put a record in there by accident that isn't among my favorites, can
you spot it? I'm certainly not going to go through the process of making it again!

- *Ashes Grammar* by **A Sunny Day in Glasgow** - While most of the bands were
  trying to conjure up the sprit of the 80s, these guys were making the kind of
  electronic, vaguely world music sounds that are straight out of the mid-90s. A
  strange little art rock record that it is really hard to compare to anything.
  It manages to be densely complex, and charmingly amateurish at the same time.
  [Memory: I discovered this while perusing the Pitchfork best of 2009 list.
  This really was the best era for that website actually promoting good music.]

- *Abnormally Attracted to Sin* by **Tori Amos** - I wasn't paying very close attention to
  Tori's career when this came out, and didn't really listen to it closely until
  almost a decade later. This is as wild record, where she seems to be trying
  out some of the popular music trends that had transpired during her 20-odd
  years in the industry. "Police Me" is particularly out there sound for Tori,
  and I'm not sure how to describe what it even is. 2007-2009 was the most
  experimental and diverse time in her career. it doesn't all work, but it will
  never stop being interesting. [*Memory*: This was one of the very last CDs I
  ever purchased at a Best Buy.]

- *Merriweather Post Pavilion* by **Animal Collective** - This is one of those
  records that was absolutely huge at the time, but you rarely hear about now.
  It still really holds up pretty well. Kind of a low-fi, electronic *Pet
  Sounds*, I rarely listen to it anymore, but always enjoy when I do. [*Memory*:
  This was one of the first albums I bought in 2009, and one of the first new
  releases I purchased on vinyl. I tried to buy it from Greg at City Lights, but
  he refused to switch back to vinyl. Probably why his store is no longer with
  us.]
  
- *Hospice* by **The Antlers** - As my mix-notes indicate above, this was my
  album of the year at the time. That isn't true anymore, but I still think this
  is a beautiful and haunted set of songs that I'm alway happy hear. However,
  the sullen mood and subject matter is something that I'm generally no seeking
  out. [*Memory*: I saw them play almost the entire album in sequence at
  Pitchfork Music Festival in 2009, and that powerful performance was one of the
  best I have ever seen]

- *Humbug* by **Arctic Monkeys** - I had enjoyed their first two records, but
  for some reason this is where it started to really click for me. They are
  mining the goth sounds that I love here a bit. It is also the album where the
  pop song-craft really started to take form. "Crying Lightning" is a remarkable
  pop-rock song. [*Memory*: When I moved to rochester my record collection had
  started to grow significantly. I remember constructing new record crates to
  store them, sitting on the old green carpet in the entry hall of my tiny attic
  apartment.]

- *Best Rest Forth Mouth* by **Bear in Heaven** - Ah, the era of the percussive
  electronic music. These guys were the best at it, and they didn't even need
  a floor tom guy to make it work. It was refreshing to see bands that were
  working in a synthpop adjacent space, who had no interest in digging up the
  80s. [*Memory*: The lead singer of this band had a great ironic mustache,
  which was the style of the time. Shortly their after, Movember, was developed
  as an excuse for men to grow mustaches again. I would grow a pretty sweet one
  of my own.]
  
- *March of the Zapotec/Holland* by **Beirut** - This collection of two EPs, is
  highly successful in two very different genres. The first, is the typical
  world music, chamber pop this guy is generally making, but with a huge brass
  band. The second is delightful, early 90s techno. The combination works great
  together somehow. [*Memory*: These guys embody the 2000s more than anyone. I
  had to pick a performance by them from Pitchfork 2009 for the banner on this page.]

- *Susan Storm's Ugly Sister and Other Saints and Superheroes* by **Rachel
  Taylor Brown** - Such a cool concept for an album that is done mostly really
  well. Less famous (mostly imaginary, and quite troubled) comic book
  characters, and religious myths (The original superheroes). [*Memory*: I don't
  know if this is true or not, but I remember this CD as the first thing I ever
  ordered online and had delivered to my new home of Rochester.]

- *The Hazards of Love* by **The Decemberists** - This band had been heading
  down a road of fairy tales and prog rock that peaked with with release. Some
  great vocal contributions from Shara Nova of **My Brightest Diamond**. I wish
  it was a little shorter, and would probably come back to it more if it had
  been trimmed down a bit. [*Memory*: There was an amazing full performance
  video of this on YouTube back in the day, I really wish that was still
  available.] 
  
- *Bitte Orca* by **Dirty Projectors** - I don't know that a band has ever done
  more with less technical proficiency (outside of punk music anyway). I don't
  think this record is as intentionally arty as the reviews would have you
  believe. This is a band stretching their skills way beyond the advisable. So
  charmingly amateurish, and somehow it adds up to way more than its individual
  parts. Everyone in this band had a completely untrained voice, and it all
  works.[*Memory*: I was very resistent to this record at first given how rough
  around the edges it is, and how much Pitchfork was pushing it.]

- *The Duckworth Lewis Method* by **The Duckworth Lewis Method** - A very late
  addition that I discovered more than a decade after release. Amazing in the
  way **The Divine Comedy** always is, but with a sense of whimsey that could
  only be produced by a concept album about the sport of cricket. I don't
  understand all the references here, but the examination of Britain's falling
  stature in the game, as an analogy for larger world issues is hard to miss.
  [*Memory*: I listened to this album more than any other in the year of 2021,
  and it even inspired me to research, and learn the rules and strategy of
  cricket so I could understand it better.]

- *Tarot Sport* by **Fuck Buttons** - I think they tried to come up with a new
  genre name for this kind of thing, but looking back it just fits on the
  electronic branch of the post rock tree. Such positive high energy music, I
  used to put this on the end of running playlists to get me home from long
  runs. [*Memory*: This is the first new release that I really had to extend
  effort to get on vinyl. I imported a copy from Amazon UK.]

- *Con Law* by **Generationals** - Remembering back to this era I think of two
  things: Chillwave, and this kind of straightforward, dance-able pop music.
  This first record has a rawness to it that would be sanded off in their later,
  more big-budget releases. They work better in this lower fidelity format.
  [*Memory*: One of the many great bands I saw play to a mostly empty room at
  Bugjar. Those who were there had a great time bopping around to these guys.]

- *Album* by **Girls** - One of my favorite bands of all time, and I pretty much
  love everything they did in their short career. My favorite will always be
  this collection of stunning pop songs. "Hellhole Ratrace" is a remarkable
  story of refusing to give up, and learning to go it alone when there is no one
  else to lean on. [*Memory*: I'm so glad I was able to catch these guys at
  Pitchfork 2010, as they would break up not long after.]
 
- *Veckatimest* by **Grizzly Bear** - This was my point of entry for this band.
  There first couple records didn't connect with me, but there was something
  about the more tightly constructed songs on this album that made me appreciate
  their psych folk sound way more. I can't think of a group with a more
  distinctive sound, and every record since this one has had a very similar
  feel, but I'm not anywhere close to being tired of it. [*Memory*: On one of my
  first extended business trips to Rochester, I remember brining along my newly
  purchased CD of this one. I remember for some reason I was assigned a full
  size pickup as my rental car. I also remember how amazing "Two Weeks" sounded
  the first time I heard it while pulling into the East Henrietta Country Inn
  and Suites.]

- *Here We Go Magic* by **Here We Go Magic** - If you were to strip **Grizzly
  Bear** back to the bare essentials, you would have something like this record.
  The next album, by the full band version of this act would blow this away, but
  there is some real magic in songs like "Fangela". [*Memory*: When I saw this
  band in 2010 I bought a shirt with the cover of this album on it. It had a
  hold in the sleeve, and I never wore it.]

- *Seek Magic* by **Memory Tapes** - This guy always hated being lumped in with
  the Chillwave bands. I can kind of understand why, as this is built from
  mostly very different parts. That said, the highly melodic and psychedelic
  sounds on offer here invoke the same sort of painful nostalgia for a 1980s
  that never existed. "Plain Material" is one of my all time favorite songs, and
  it is hard to hear it without seeing a crowd of wayfarer wearing hipsters
  bopping around in Union Park, Chicago. [*Memory*: At Pitchfork 2009, this
  record was for sale at the same amazing booth that had the Minimal Wave
  compilations. I passed on it, and regretted it for almost a decade. I was
  eventually able to get a vinyl reissue of this one.]

- *Fantasies* by **Metric** - The last great album by one of the great Canadian
  indie bands, in the year that the Canadian renaissance started to wrap up. I
  know they are still out there making music, but this is where it all starts
  sounding the same to me. [*Memory*: This is one of the very first CDs that I
  bought at Lakeshore Record Exchange, the alternative record store a two blocks 
  walk from my new apartment in Rochester, NY.]

- *No More Stories...* by **Mew** - [**2009 FAVORITE**] - Only Scandinavians can
  make this kind of music. So warm and comfy, such catchy pop songs. This isn't
  chillwave, but it is making clear references to same imagined version of the
  1980s. [*Memory*: I wish I knew how much I liked this band so I went to see
  them at Pitchfork 2009 on the B stage.]

- *Wind's Poem* by **Mount Eerie** - Such a heavy, beautiful record. I love how
  it hides all those melodies in that sea of noise. Needs to be listened to at
  high volume full the full impact. [*Memory*: I didn't full appreciate this
  record until I listened to it on a night drive at high volume, from beginning
  to end. The way this should be experienced]

- *The Life of the World to Come* by **Mountain Goats** - For some reason this
  record separates itself from the dozens of others from this guy. It is the
  same kind of self-produced indie folk/punk, but somehow by far my favorite.
  [*Memory*: I liked this record going in, but I loved this record after seeing
  a screening of a performance film of the whole record at Noise Pop 2010.]

- *The Resistance* by **Muse** - I always heard **Queen** when I listened to
  these guys in a way that other folks did not seem to hear. Well after this
  album I think I wasn't the only one. Very over the top, and an exceptional
  hard rock album. [*Memory*: I saw them on the tour for this record in Toronto
  with some work friends.]

- *Psychic Chasms* by **Neon Indian** - This is probably the definitive
  Chillwave record and "Deadbeat Summer" the definitive song in the genre. It
  also illustrates how the low budget production values were an essential part
  of the formula. His later, more refined records just don't hold up to this
  fuzzy, messy masterpiece. [*Memory*: I don't know that any record makes me
  think of my tiny, dingy Park Avenue apartment than this one. I listened to
  this a lot back in those days.]

- *The Pains of Being Pure atHeart* by **The Pains of Being Pure at Heart** -
  There was a massive "Pitchfork backlash" against this one since the site
  seemed to be way more into this than most. That said, they were absolutely
  right, and this kind pop/rock is timeless. I think everyone expected some kind
  of C86 revival, but this is really the only major artifact we got out of it.
  [*Memory*: At the Pitchfork music festival in 2009 I had just heard **The
  Antlers** play on the B stage and I was walking over to the main stages, and I
  heard these guys playing "Stay Alive". I spontaneously starting twirling
  around in a circle as I walked. It was the last time I ever felt young.]

- *You Can Have What You Want* by **Papercuts** - A fuzzy kind of psychedelic
  music that was compatible with, but not directly related to the prevailing
  trends of the time. A great album throughout, but "The Machine WIll Tell Us
  So" is one of my songs of the decade. This record almost fits better in 1999
  than 2009 and it sounds timeless today. [*Memory*: I discovered this band
  opening for *Camera Obscura* at the German House in the Rochester South Wedge.
  I was nervous to walk through an unfamiliar neighborhood carrying my new copy
  of their LP. I now own a house in that very neighborhood.]

- *Real Estate* by **Real Estate** - Making this list it is clear how this was
  the peak of fuzzy psychedelic music. These guys are making really pleasant
  jangly pop, with the fuzz dial turned up to 11. [*Memory*: I didn't get into
  this band until I saw them at a Pitchfork after-show in 2011. I was there to
  see Dent May, but these guys were super impressive live.]

- *Junior* by **Röyksopp** - It was tough to pick a favorite for this year, as I
  was split between the one I picked and this stellar record. Interestingly, I
  didn't even put this on my list of favorite albums I made at the time! I was
  already into this band by 2009, and their ambient classic *Melody AM* was a favorite.
  This album was a shock, as they had transformed into some sort of Scandinavian
  **Daft Punk**. This is stunning electro-pop record, and I wish we had gotten
  more like it. [*Memory*: I held a vinyl copy of this in my hands once. I
  didn't understand how great it was then. I greatly regret not buying it.]

- *Small Black EP* by **Small Black** - Another of the cornerstones of
  Chillwave, this has a timeless sound that has aged really well. "Weird
  Machines" is probably my favorite track from the whole genre. These guys did
  survive the transition to more refined production values pretty well, but I
  still prefer the fuzzy, heavily clipped sound of this record. You can't keep
  making this kind of music forever though. [*Memory*: I saw these guys at
  BugJar some random weeknight and remember being disappointed by how bro-ish
  these guys looked in their athleisure gear and ball caps.]

- *Actor* by **St. Vincent** - A refinement of the sound from her first record,
  and by far my favorite release by the artist. Eccentric bedroom pop with a
  sharp rock edge, made without any notion of stardom or awareness of mass
  popularity. Things would change after this record, in ways I did not care for.
  [*Memory*: I saw her at Noise Pop 2009 (Great American Music Hall) right
  before this came out. It was an outstanding show, and how I will always prefer
  to remember the artist.]

- *Suckers EP* by **Suckers** - I'm not exactly sure how to describe this genre,
  but it falls in the same space as bands like **Yeasayer** or **Menomena**.
  Highly percussive, with meandering instrumental passages, and serious music
  that isn't afraid to be very fun. They didn't last long, but what they made
  was great. [*Memory*: One of the last conversations I had with Greg at City
  Lights Records (State College, PA) was about this record. He knew I was very
  into **MGMT** and **Menomena** and he asked if I had heard the other band on
  the big summer tour (these guys). He spun his CD-R of the EP for me.]

- *The BQE* by **Sufjan Stevens** - Mark this down as one of those records I
  like way more than almost anyone else. An amazing film soundtrack that borders
  on Contemporary Classical, and Sufjan pushing his middle period sound to its
  fullest extreme. This was also gave a preview of the electronic sounds that
  were to come. [*Memory*: I bought this (with a wad of other releases) at
  Lakeshore Record Exchange and listened to them repeatedly as I taught myself
  how to wax my cross-country skiis in the basement lab at my work.]

- *The XX* by **The XX** - A minimalist rock record that was wildly popular at
  the time and that you hear little about today. My personal relationship has a
  similar arc to it. One of my very favorites at the time, but something I
  rarely find myself returning to today. Minimalism is tough. If what little is
  there doesn't have a lot of depth to it, it gets old quick. That said, I have
  to include it, even if my time with it was brief but intense. [*Memory*:
  Hipster Runoff loved to make fun of this record. Carles always had a good
  understanding of what hype records were going to fade a bit over time.]

- *Spirit Animal* by **Zombi** - It was strange to hear this kind of
  instrumental prog rock in the 21st century. It not only exists, but is
  excellent, especially the epic title track. [*Memory*: I discovered this
  album when it was played before a **Dungen** show at Mohawk Place in Buffalo,
  NY. I used the Shazaam music matching service to find it, and immediately
  downloaded from eMusic. I was pleasantly surprized to see these guys play a
  great opening set for **Ghost** half a decade later.]
