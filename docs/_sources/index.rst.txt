My 21st Century GeoCities Page
==============================

There is a lot of nostalgia and fondness for the handcrafted sites of web 1.0.
Most of it is focussed on the garish aesthetics, which I do not miss at all.
Often ignored is the freeform creativity and healthy self-indulgence that only writing 
your own site from scratch can inspire. Please enjoy my minimalist attempt at a modern
version of the original web...or don't enjoy it. This isn't about you. ;)
